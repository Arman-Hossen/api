Tractor protests threaten to drive the EU's green farming policies into a ditch,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Europe/131558,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/4351870.webp,World,Europe,Tractor protests threaten to drive the EU's green farming policies into a ditch,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:6602:""<p>It was the puddles of green sludge left by the tires of massive tractors in western Belgium&rsquo;s industrial farmlands that drew the attention of biological engineer Ineke Maes.</p>
<p>The slime was destructive algae, the result of the excess of chemicals used by farmers to boost their crops, but at a high cost to nature. Maes had hoped the European Union&rsquo;s environmental policies would start to make a fundamental difference by improving exhausted soils.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, some of those tractors moved off the land and onto the roads, blocking major cities and economic lifelines from Warsaw to Madrid and from Athens to Brussels. Farmers were demanding the reversal of some of the most progressive measures in the world to counter climate change and protect biodiversity, arguing that the rules were harming their livelihoods and strangling them with red tape.</p>
<p>And the impact has been stunning.</p>
<p>The farmers' protests affected the daily lives of people across the 27-nation bloc, costing businesses tens of millions of euros in transportation delays. The disruption triggered knee jerk reactions from politicians at national and EU level: they committed to rolling back policies, some of them years in the making, on everything from the use of pesticides to limiting the amount of manure that could be spread on fields.</p>
<p>To environmentalists like Maes, who works for the Belgian Better Environment Federation umbrella group, it would almost be laughable if it were not so depressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the environmental movement, we joke that we should get tractors ourselves to make a point. Then we would be competing fair and square. The purpose should be that we get negotiations, and that we get a deal through democratic process &mdash; the rules, you know,"" she said. Reasoned arguments, she says, have been drowned out by the rumble of tractor engines.</p>
<p>And there's no end in sight.</p>
<p>After hundreds of tractors disrupted the EU summit in Brussels early this month at a volume that kept some leaders awake at night, farmers plan to return on Monday. They intend to be there when agriculture ministers discuss an emergency item on the agenda &mdash; the simplification of agricultural rules and a decrease in checks at farms that environmentalists fear could amount to a further weakening of standards.</p>
<p>The political noise level from the tractors &mdash; not to mention the loads of manure dumped outside official buildings &mdash; does get through, officials said. &ldquo;That puts a bit more pressure on the ministers inside. So I would believe that ministers will be a bit more &mdash; insisting to have concrete results,&rdquo; said a high-level EU official, who asked not to be identified because the meeting has yet to take place.</p>
<p>It is this attitude that drives the environmental lobby and NGOs to distraction: knowing that scientific arguments are too often no match for the rule of the street. As a result, the EU's flagship Green Deal, that aims to make the continent carbon-neutral by 2050, is under threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really should not lose that long-term view, that vision of the future when you are working on policy,&rdquo; said Maes. &ldquo;You should not respond to the issues of the day by simply scrapping very important rules that have been seriously discussed, considered, that have been included in environmental impact reports and so on &mdash; and that have also been democratically approved in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet ahead of Monday's farm protest and meeting of agriculture ministers, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, for many the most powerful EU politician, insisted that she &ldquo;remains fully committed to delivering solutions to ease the pressure currently felt by our hard-working farming women and men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Von der Leyen's change in emphasis comes ahead of the June 6-9 elections, when a good showing by her Christian Democrat group, the European People's Party, will be key to keeping her at the helm of the all-powerful Commission. As her party has swayed toward putting farmers and industry first, so has she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a bit difficult putting a pin on Mrs. von der Leyen,&rdquo; said Jutta Paulus, a Green member of the European Parliament. ""She started off in 2019 being a climate and environment champion, more or less saying, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need the Greens anymore, we are green ourselves.&rsquo; And now she says: &lsquo;Well industry called me and they are worried. So I have to do something.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the wake of the tractor protests, action came fast and furious.</p>
<p>Early this month, von der Leyen's Commission shelved an important anti-pesticide proposal, insisting &ldquo;a different approach is needed.&rdquo; She also allowed farmers to continue using some land they had been required to keep fallow to promote biodiversity. And the proposals on the table for Monday's meeting about simplifying paperwork go in the same direction.</p>
<p>At the same time, a nature restoration law which was seen as another element in the Green Deal aspiration has already been watered down to appease farmers before it goes to a final legislative vote next Tuesday.</p>
<p>And at a national level, politicians have been bending the same way, from France to Spain and Belgium.</p>

<p>Flanders, in northern Belgium, has already relaxed its policy on the use of manure which was intended to limit emissions of nitrates that can harm water quality. Under pressure from multinational food manufacturers, whose processing plants dwarf even the biggest family farms in western Belgium, farmers are likely to stick with the industrial methods that exhaust soils and pollute waterways, Maes fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is mind-boggling that this whole process is now grinding to a halt,&rdquo; she said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-26 08:38:22,2024-02-26 09:19:42

<p>The meeting in Nairobi is the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, and governments, civil society groups, scientists and the private sector are attending.</p>
<p>“None of us live on an island. We live on planet Earth, and we are all connected,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, which is leading the process, told The Associated Press ahead of the talks. “The only way we can solve some of these problems is by talking together.”</p>
<p>At the meeting, member states discuss a raft of draft resolutions on a range of issues that the assembly adopts upon consensus. If a proposal is adopted, it sets the stage for countries to implement what’s been agreed on.</p>
<p>In the last round of talks in 2022, also in Nairobi, governments adopted 14 resolutions, including to create a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution globally. Andersen described it then as the most significant environmental multilateral deal since the Paris Agreement to limit global warming.</p>

<p>For this year’s talks, countries have submitted 20 draft resolutions for discussion, including on how best to restore degraded lands, combat dust storms and reduce the environmental impact of metal and mineral mining.</p>
<p>But with countries having different priorities, it’s often hard to get consensus on the draft resolutions. However, Andersen said, there’s generally “a forward movement” on all draft resolutions for this year's meeting, known as UNEA-6.</p>
<p>With this meeting's focus on multilateralism, UNEP wants to build on past agreements it led between governments, such as the Minamata Convention to put controls on mercury and the Montreal Protocol to heal the hole in the ozone layer, Andersen said.</p>

<p>Björn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, thinks there'll be slow progress on more complex issues such as financing around chemicals and waste.</p>
<p>Beeler also expects strong opposition on a draft resolution that wants to phase out the use of highly hazardous pesticides. The draft resolution, which was submitted by Ethiopia and is co-sponsored by Uruguay, aims to create a global alliance of U.N. bodies like UNEP, the World Health Organization and the International Labor Organization.</p>
<p>“If this does go through, it would be very significant because it would be the first time ever to see global movement on highly hazardous pesticides,” said Beeler, who is attending the talks.</p>
<p>UNEP anticipates more than 70 government ministers and 3,000 delegates at the talks.</p>
<p>“What we should expect at UNEA-6 is decision makers looking into the horizon, being aware of what is it that’s coming to us that could potentially damage our planet, and taking preemptive action to prevent this,” said Andersen.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The United States said it will continue to&nbsp; support Bangladesh in strengthening its capacity and mobilizing resources to accelerate implementation of climate adaptation, resilience, and mitigation measures to minimize risks of climate-vulnerable populations becoming human trafficking victims.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Helen LaFave joined AKM Tipu Sultan, Additional Secretary (Political and ICT Wing), Public Security Division, Ministry of Home Affairs, and representatives of other ministries as well as local and international organizations at the official launch of the Bangladesh Program to End Modern Slavery (B-PEMS) the &lsquo;AugroJatra&rsquo; project, implemented by Winrock International.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The program underlines the commitment by Bangladesh and the United States to work together to combat both human trafficking and climate change, said the US Embassy in Dhaka.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With support from the U.S. Department of State, AugroJatra will enhance knowledge on the link between climate change, human trafficking, and modern slavery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">By gathering evidence throughout Bangladesh, the project will reduce vulnerability to exploitation and human trafficking that often accompanies loss of property and livelihoods caused by climate change among farming and fishing households, said the US Embassy.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The project aims to improve climate-resilient livelihoods for at-risk populations and encourage cross integration of climate change adaptation and human trafficking prevention into policies and plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The project will be implemented across 11 districts in Bangladesh, including Rangpur, Gaibandha, Lalmonirhat, Faridpur, Shariatpur, Madaripur, Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Barishal, and Patuakhali.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

FAO supports Bangladesh in strengthening pesticide regulations,Kazi Farzana Haque,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Foreign Affairs/131642,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6513594.webp,Bangladesh,Foreign Affairs,FAO supports Bangladesh in strengthening pesticide regulations,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5022:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has officially handed over its recommendations on the pesticide rules to the Department of Agricultural Extension under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Representatives from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change participated in a workshop held on Tuesday on collaboration in relevant component of the projects.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saso Martinov, Senior Technical Advisor, FAO Bangladesh and Dr Fahmida Khanom, Additional Secretary (Development) of&nbsp; the ministry participated&nbsp; in the event.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&nbsp; was chaired by Ashraf Uddin, Director, Plant Protection Wing, Department of Agricultural Extension.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The government of Bangladesh, in collaboration with FAO, is taking crucial steps to update the Pesticide Rules under the Pesticide Act of 2018, prioritizing public health and environmental protection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This collaborative effort aims to incorporate international best legal practices into the pesticide regulations and ensure the safe and responsible use of these chemicals in the country. The initiative is done under the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) project that is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saso Martinov, Senior Technical Advisor, FAO stated that, &ldquo;This is an important step in managing pesticides that are used in agriculture in Bangladesh. FAO team has handed over its recommendation on the pesticide rules today and will continue to support the Government of Bangladesh in its efforts to reduce the risks of pesticides following FAO&rsquo;s 4 Betters including a better life and a better environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dr Fahmida Khanom, Additional Secretary (Development), MoEFCC highlighted FAO&rsquo;s support in Bangladesh's achievement of becoming free from DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and said &ldquo;The government now wants to focus heavily on proper handling and recycling of toxic pesticide containers and the recommendations will work as a buffer for future activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One key focus area of the Pesticide Rules is the transparent and comprehensive pesticide registration process, overseen by the Director of the Plant Protection Wing of the Department of Agricultural Extension under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A great majority of citizens of Bangladesh rely on agriculture for food security.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Improper pesticide use can lead to residues exceeding safe limits on food crops, posing health risks to consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, unregulated pesticide use can harm beneficial insects, pollute water sources, and contaminate soil, jeopardizing biodiversity and ecosystem health. Stringent registration enables evaluation of potential environmental impacts as well as risks to human health before allowing pesticides into the market for consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">FAO Recommendations aim to implement more strict measures to prevent the infiltration of highly hazardous pesticides into the market.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This includes rigorous assessments of potential risks to human health and the environment before granting registration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The initiative prioritizes safe and responsible pesticide waste disposal. FAO Recommendations would incorporate robust regulations to ensure proper collection, transportation, and treatment of pesticide waste, minimizing the risk of environmental contamination.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recognizing the environmental impact of pesticide packaging, the project also provides guidance on its management in line with the Environment Conservation Act of 1995 and the Solid Waste Management Rules of 2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This will promote environmentally responsible packaging practices and contribute to a cleaner and healthier Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Implementing the updated Pesticide Rules requires concrete action.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A nationwide collection program for pesticide containers supported by FAO, coupled with awareness campaigns and incentives, will ensure responsible disposal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Training inspectors and empowering local authorities will strengthen enforcement, also engaging farmers through education programmes promoting safe handling and application, protecting themselves and the environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These crucial steps would pave the way for a healthier Bangladesh where responsible pesticide use safeguards public health and the environment.</p>

<p>The WTO's (World Trade Organisation) 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) has begun on Monday and it will end on Thursday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Ministers from across the world are attending the conference to review the functioning of the multilateral trading system and to take action on the future work of the WTO.</p>
<p>Three of the NGO representatives were briefly detained on various allegations in the first two days of the conference. One of them is an Indian peasant leader, who handed a paper to a journalist he knew. He was immediately arrested for allegedly distributing leaflets inside the convention centre, a detainable offence.</p>
<p>Two other non-government delegates from Norway and the United States were detained for taking pictures inside the convention centre. The security personnel also stopped leaflet distribution, confiscated placards, and stopped them from taking photos of their own actions, according to a press release received here on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>""This is my 11th MC and I've never seen anything like this level of repression. The WTO Secretariat has insisted that it is working towards clarifying things with the host country. But we see no evidence that the DG &ndash; who is widely known as a person who, shall we say, can get her way when she wants &ndash; is insisting on our rights being restored.&rdquo; said Deborah James, facilitator of the global Our World Is Not for Sale (OWINFS) network of CSOs (Civil Society Organisation).</p>
<p>The WTO Director General, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has billed this ministerial meeting as the most &ldquo;open, transparent and inclusive process&rdquo; to date. Yet her institution is failing to ensure participants that the guiding information communicated by the WTO, and the prevailing practice with regards to what civil society can do, actually holds for MC13, Ms James added.</p>
<p>""Participants, especially from developing countries, are fearful of even walking alone in the conference centre now, lest they be unjustly detained and possibly deported, and then unable to secure visas ever again. This climate of fear should not be the result of advocacy in an institution of global economic governance,"" said Rahmat Maulana Sidik, executive director of Indonesia for Global Justice, according to the release.</p>

<p>The global event will take place on March 1-3, 2024, under the auspices of Tayyip Erdogan, President of the Republic of T&uuml;rkiye, and on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of T&uuml;rkiye.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister will be visiting T&uuml;rkiye at the invitation of his Turkish counterpart and is expected to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the Forum, a senior official told UNB.</p>
<p>Turkish Ambassador to Bangladesh Ramis Şen recently met Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud and highlighted the Antalya Diplomacy Forum.</p>
<p>The Ambassador hoped that Foreign Minister Hasan will actively join the Forum.</p>
<p>In its third edition, the Antalya Diplomacy Forum will gather heads of states and governments, ministers, diplomats, business leaders, academics, think-tankers, and youth and media representatives for an all-encompassing debate.</p>
<p>The overarching theme of this year&rsquo;s Forum will be &ldquo;Advancing Diplomacy in Times of Turmoil&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It aims to serve as a thorough reflection and the means for searching a peaceful way out of the turbulent period our world is going through.</p>
<p>Ongoing wars, acts of terrorism, irregular migration, rise of xenophobia and Islamophobia, unforeseen risks of AI, climate change, natural disasters, pandemics and widening socioeconomic gaps form a non-exhaustive list of global challenges.</p>
<p>The erosion and subsequently the loss of trust in the rules-based international order is also a worrying trend, undermining the predictability of the environment in which states operate.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the world is going through a period of several turmoils and these challenges may also act as agents leading to structural changes in the global political, economic and security landscape.</p>
<p>Moreover, as one third of the world&rsquo;s population is heading to the polls in 2024, many questions about the impact of elections on pressing international issues as well as concerns on AI manipulated disinformation and fake news will be on the international agenda.</p>
<p>How do we make better use of diplomacy to tackle global challenges in the current state of affairs?</p>
<p>The answer certainly lies in the adoption of a novel understanding of diplomacy, beyond its essential and traditional framework of dialogue.</p>
<p>For that purpose, the host country said, the Antalya Diplomacy Forum will once again provide its distinguished participants an interactive and thought-provoking platform to address the challenging issues shaping the global and regional agendas, and to discuss innovative tools to advance diplomacy in times of turmoil.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-28 22:04:06,

"Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors, genuine willingness keys to take Dhaka-Washington ties to next stage",Farid Hossain,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6506592.webp,Special,,"Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors, genuine willingness keys to take Dhaka-Washington ties to next stage","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:2:{i:0;s:5693:""<p>Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors and a genuine willingness to broaden ties in new areas will drive forward the Bangladesh-US relations to the next level leaving behind pre-election political differences between the two countries, experts opine viewing post-polls relations.</p>
<p>“Both countries have long and old ties in every aspect of statecraft and bilateral relations. The new chapter denotes that these two countries would deepen their engagement beyond the much-debated political differences,” Prof Shahab Enam Khan of Jahangirnagar University’s Department of International Relations told UNB this week.</p>
<p>A senior US government delegation visited Bangladesh last week with an agenda that included strengthening diplomatic ties and advancing shared interests in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The delegation comprised Eileen Laubacher, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for South Asia, US National Security Council (NSC); Michael Schiffer, USAID Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Asia; and Afreen Akhter, US Department of State Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Their discussions also focused on climate change, trade, the Rohingya refugee crisis, and labor rights. The delegation met with senior officials, business executives, civil society organisations, and top opposition leaders.</p>
<p>Prof Shahab, who is also executive director and CEO at Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs, assumes the issues of Bangladesh’s national security and the Indo-Pacific agenda coincide with the US ones.</p>
<p>Hence, he thinks, the bilateral relations will get new momentum in defense, security, non-traditional security, and human security issues.</p>
<p>“Myanmar, too, is a wake-up call here. This further gives me a sense that the US would not see Bangladesh through any third-country prism,” said the international affairs expert.</p>
<p>Instead, he thinks, both countries may synchronise their mutual interests in the coming days. “Bangladesh, after all, has been the most dependable country for the superpowers as it comes with no fractured ties with the regional neighbours or any hyped-up political or security narratives.”</p>
<p>Prof Shahab said these two factors make Bangladesh a regional security guarantor needed to keep the Indo-Pacific region stable.</p>
<p><strong>A New Chapter and Priorities</strong></p>
<p>Asked about the priority areas in opening a new chapter in their relations with Bangladesh, US Embassy spokesperson Haynes Mahoney said Bangladesh is an Indo-Pacific partner and the United States is Bangladesh’s largest source of foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>“We are committed to working together to ensure the Indo-Pacific region remains free, open, peaceful, and secure. We also engage with Bangladesh on broader sets of priorities,” he told UNB.</p>
<p>“As President Biden has stated, we will look at ways to build on our long-standing partnership to improve economic growth, mitigate climate change, and to invest in people so they have opportunities to lead healthier and more prosperous lives,” Haynes added.</p>
<p>The US is pleased to see Bangladesh’s Indo-Pacific outlook, which he thinks “really mirrors” what they are trying to do in terms of economic investment, working with Bangladesh on climate change, and building out security and defense cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is, of course, one of the largest UN Peacekeeping contributors, and we are very pleased to support that effort, Haynes said.</p>
<p>Highlighting economic opportunities, he said leveraging their investments in development through the private sector and engaging youth are areas that they are increasingly focused on.</p>
<p>“We are bringing business leaders and youth together to identify ways to equip young people with more marketable job-skills – creating a more talented workforce with the skills needed to drive companies towards greater success and help Bangladesh be more competitive in the global marketplace,” he said.</p>
<p>The US Embassy spokesperson said they continue to identify ways to strengthen the economic and trade ties between the two countries, while building on our work together to accelerate socio-economic development so that people in all corners of the country have equitable opportunities to live healthier and more prosperous lives.</p>
<p>“We are looking for ways in which we can collaborate with Bangladesh to modernize its military and be able to invest in maritime domain awareness to be able to understand what is on your coastal borders, what is coming in by air, land, and sea,"" he said.</p>
<p><strong>Issues around GSOMIA and ACSA</strong></p>
<p>Asked about the progress regarding the two proposed agreements - General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) and the Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), Haynes said GSOMIA is being considered between the US and Bangladesh armed forces as the two sides continue to explore opportunities for “more substantive and deeper” engagement.</p>
<p>The agreement is effectively a commitment that each side will effectively secure any information or sensitive materials received from the other, he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he said, ACSA facilitate the exchange of logistical support between partner militaries and enhance the opportunities for meaningful engagement.</p>
<p>Although there are no discussions at present between the US and Bangladesh about pursuing an ACSA, this could change in the future should the two sides determine it offers sufficient benefit, Haynes said.</p>
<p> </p>"";i:1;s:4595:""<p><strong>Myanmar Situation and Its Impacts</strong></p>
<p>“Obviously, we are very concerned, and we are following the developments in Burma [Myanmar] closely. The ongoing clashes in Burma [Myanmar] are deeply troubling. This is a significant concern not only for the region but also for the international community,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>He said the ongoing crisis in Myanmar is a pressing issue, and the United States has contributed more than two billion dollars in humanitarian assistance to this crisis, including approximately $500 million in Myanmar.</p>
<p>“It is essential to address the root causes of the crisis, promote stability, and work towards finding a sustainable and humane resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>They emphasised the need for diplomatic efforts and international cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the situation in Myanmar, aiming for a “comprehensive and inclusive” approach to ensure the well-being of the affected populations and regional stability.</p>
<p>“We also recognize the need to continue support for civilians displaced by the conflict in Burma, including both internally displaced people in Burma and Rohingya refugees residing in Bangladesh,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the United States provided an additional $87 million to continue providing food and nutrition assistance to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, which helped raise the monthly food rations for refugees to $10 per person per month.</p>
<p>“That was an important step to make sure they are getting enough food and nutrition to stay healthy. We also continue to provide support to Bangladeshi host communities through a range of multisectoral interventions, including job-skills and business literacy training to help people improve their livelihoods,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p><strong>A Positive Shift</strong></p>
<p>South Asia Institute Director at the Wilson Center and writer of Foreign Policy's weekly South Asia Brief Michael Kugelman has said US-Bangladesh relations have taken a more positive turn after a Bangladesh election that the US described as not free or fair.</p>
<p>He explained why, and also argued that this shift is not actually as sharp as it seems and noted that the visit came amid an apparent shift in bilateral relations, especially in terms of tone and messaging.</p>
<p>In the months ahead of Bangladesh’s Jan. 7 elections, the United States took strong steps to promote human rights and democracy, including through sanctions, visa restrictions, and public criticism.</p>
<p>Though that US State Department characterised the vote as not free or fair, US President Joe Biden sent a letter to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that welcomed the “next chapter” in the US-Bangladesh relationship; it did not mention rights or democracy.</p>
<p>During the U.S. delegation’s visit this week, Bangladeshi officials, including Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud, underscored the fresh start theme.</p>
<p>Salman F Rahman, an advisor to PM Hasina, said the “election is now a thing of the past.” Messaging from both sides was warm and effusive, with plenty of references to the partnership’s strength.</p>
<p>What accounts for the turnaround? Michael Kugelman said one possibility is Washington’s desire to distance itself from the highly charged political environment in Dhaka.</p>
<p>“The more U.S. officials publicly opine about human rights and democracy in Bangladesh, the more they risk getting dragged into it,” he wrote in Foreign Policy’s South Asia Brief.</p>
<p>He said strategic considerations are also likely at play and the previous US approach effectively gave Beijing and Moscow an advantage in Dhaka and rankled New Delhi.</p>
<p>“Geopolitical factors also play a role in the new US approach. The conflict in neighboring Myanmar is intensifying, and Bangladesh hosts hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees but seeks to repatriate them,” Kugelman said.</p>
<p>Washington wants to ensure that it has sufficient diplomatic space to engage with Dhaka on these sensitive issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kugelman said with US foreign-policy attention increasingly focused on instability in the Middle East, the United States wants to reduce diplomatic headaches elsewhere.</p>
<p>“The relationship’s tone and messaging are emphasizing positivity and potential, not public pressure. Ultimately, this reflects that, for now, the United States has concluded that smooth relations with Bangladesh are a strategic imperative,” he said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:2:{i:0;s:25:""news/details/4432665.webp"";i:1;s:25:""news/details/6120685.webp"";}s:8:""captions"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}}",2024-03-01 15:54:40,2024-03-01 16:01:35
Engagement of private sectors is necessary in climate finance: Saber,Shayan S Khan,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Others/131805,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/8514853.webp,Bangladesh,Others,Engagement of private sectors is necessary in climate finance: Saber,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:1555:""<p>Involvement of private sectors is crucial in climate finance, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Saber Hossain Chowdhury said on Friday.</p>
<p>He said the private sector is not interested in Climate Adaptation financing. They need to be incentivized and motivated to invest in adaptation activities.</p>
<p>The minister was addressing a session entitled 'Ensuring Public and Private Financial Flows Aligned with Environmental Goals to Close the Massive Funding' at the 6th United Nations Environment Conference being held in Kenya&rsquo;s Nairobi on Friday.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said the leadership of the government of the world made pledges in the past in which promises were unkept. The environmental goals even become stiffer and the resources we need are going to be far greater. Urgency and delivering of commitment not just signing, pledges and making landmark resolutions but implementing is a must.</p>
<p>Environment Minister said Bangladesh formulated a plan for transitioning from vulnerability to resilience and ultimately to prosperity. It requires a significant investment, estimated at nearly $80 billion. Bangladesh, with its abundant offshore wind and nature-based solutions, has outlined a plan for climate finance.</p>

These include the Land Zoning Project and the Bangladesh Digital Survey Program. These initiatives will reduce environmental damage in the country by encouraging and enforcing sustainable land use practices, he said.</p>
<p>The minister said this while inaugurating the two-day 2nd International Conference on Environment at Journalist Liaquat Ali Auditorium of Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Academic Building of Khulna University (KU) on Saturday. The theme of the summit is 'Time for Nature and Natural Resource Management'.</p>
<p>Khulna University Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr. Mahmood Hossain presided over the inaugural function while Professor Emeritus of BRAC University and climate change expert Prof. Dr. Ainun Nishat, Pro-Vice Chancellor of Khulna University Prof. Dr. Mosummath Hosna Ara and Dean of the Life Science School Prof. Dr. Abul Kalam Azad were also present.</p>

<p>The Land Minister said that under the land zoning project, they will prepare a digital map and land use plan based on Mouza and Plot division. This includes categorizing land into specific uses such as agricultural, residential, commercial, tourism, and industrial development based on the quality assessment of the land.</p>
<p>The minister said that by using land zoning project data and maps, unplanned urbanization, housing, house construction, development activities, and industrial road construction will be prevented. Environmental protection and production of food crops will be continued by maintaining the class or nature of the land, he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The land minister also said through this, planned and optimum use of land including protection of agricultural land, forests, hills, rivers, canals, and water bodies will be ensured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said the land zoning project will prove to be invaluable to &lsquo;Nature and Natural Resource Management'.</p>
<p>Earlier, paying tribute to the memory of the Father of the Nation, the Land Minister said, after victory in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took various steps to combat pollution and conserve biodiversity in newly independent Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The minister said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina realized that it would not be possible to achieve a Smart, Sonar Bangla &mdash; to materialize the dream of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman &mdash; without taking sustainable measures. She has taken robust policies and plans to protect Bangladesh from the adverse effects of climate change and global warming and create a pollution-free environment in the country. In 2011, she took the initiative to bring the conservation and development of environment and biodiversity as a constitutional obligation and adopted the long-term delta plan.</p>

<p>Plenary Speaker of the conference, Dr. Ainun Nishat said the issue of climate change is now a harsh reality. It is clear that it now rains during Hemanta (dry season), and winter is not as cold as it should be. Besides, salinity in the Khulna region has increased significantly. Dr. Ainun Nishat stressed that food security has now become a major concern for most countries globally due to climate change. He underscored the need for implementing changes in the agricultural management system in Bangladesh. Moreover, he stressed the need to ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of ecosystems and the benefits derived from them.</p>
<p>Thanking the Land Minister and other guests, Vice-Chancellor Prof. Dr. Mahmud Hossain said that diverse natural resources are essential for sustainable ecosystems, which can contribute to health, livelihood, and shelter. He stressed the need for research on nature and natural resource management for food security and poverty alleviation.</p>

<p>Bangladesh urged the global community to urgently change the definition of climate migrants and refugees to bring it in line with the UN definition of migrants and refugees.</p>
<p>He mentioned that life thrives only on this planet as far as we know.</p>
<p>At the first panel discussion of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum held in Antalya, T&uuml;rkiye on Saturday, the Foreign Minister spoke on global climate change, climate migrant and climate refugee issues.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers of Malaysia and Bangladesh, State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, and Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Vietnam discussed various aspects of the &ldquo;Building Asia-Pacific Regional Architecture: The Challenge of Unmatching Interests&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hasan mentioned that like many small and island nations, Bangladesh has become one of the worst sufferers of climate change and global warming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire coastal area of Bangladesh is at the risk of inundation due to the sea level rise and over the last three decades, rise of greenhouse gases, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""And this phenomenon is constantly causing climate migration. The issue is now so real that Bangladesh urgently needs the world community to change the definition of climate migrants and refugees,"" he said.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister mentioned that while the country and many environmental scientists have been focusing on the issue for many years, many world leaders have not believed in it until lately it has become evident to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Yet the rich countries, the major contributors to global warming, are doing very little to address the issue and protect our environment,"" Hasan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are local issues that make the impact global.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bangladesh, as one of the worst sufferers of this harsh reality, urged all activists and leaders to accept the importance of changing the definition of climate migrants and refugees and devise an acceptable definition of it to protect the victims and the future generations, said the Foreign Minister.&nbsp;</p>

Fishermen return to crab collection in Sundarbans after a 2-month ban,Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/2110111.webp,Environment,,Fishermen return to crab collection in Sundarbans after a 2-month ban,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:2890:""<p>Fishermen have resumed collecting crabs in the Sundarbans following the conclusion of a two-month government-enforced ban designed to safeguard the breeding season of crabs.</p>
<p>The ban, aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the crab population, ended last Thursday at midnight, with fishermen from coastal regions such as Mongla, Rampal, and Dakope seen entering the forest on Sunday with necessary equipment for crab collection.</p>
<p>The hiatus, necessitated by the breeding season of crabs in January and February, saw the issuance of pass-permits by the forest department halted. With the ban lifted, permits are once again being distributed, allowing the fishermen to legally collect crabs from the Sundarbans' extensive network of rivers and canals.</p>

<p>Spanning 6,017 sqkm in Bangladesh, including 1,874.1 sqkm of aquatic areas, the Sundarbans are home to 450 rivers and canals, along with 14 species of crabs.</p>
<p>To protect these species, certain canals have been designated as sanctuaries, with restrictions on crab collection in canals narrower than 25 feet enforced year-round.</p>
<p>Approximately 15,000 fishermen, equipped with valid forest department passes, depend on crab collecting within the non-restricted areas of the Sundarbans for their livelihood. The annual ban, instituted following the establishment of crab export guidelines, seeks to balance economic needs with environmental conservation.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Special/sundarbans-day-in-southwestern-region-on-feb-14-a-clarion-call-to-love-save-the-forest/130765"">Sundarbans Day in southwestern region on Feb 14; a clarion call to love, save the forest</a></p>
<p>Anisur Rahman, a crab collector from Joymoni in Mongla, highlighted the financial hardships faced by the fishermen due to the ban, pointing out the lack of governmental assistance during this period. Despite the ban's intent, there have been reports of illegal crab collection during the breeding season, undermining conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Mihir Kumar Doe, the forest Conservator of the Khulna region, confirmed that legal crab collection could resume in designated areas from March 2, with forest guards instructed to enhance patrolling to prevent illegal activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, strict guidelines have been put in place for the transportation of crabs, with divisional actions promised against violators.</p>
<p>This move to resume crab collection comes as a relief to many fishermen reliant on the trade, while the forest department remains vigilant against practices that could harm the Sundarbans' ecological balance.</p>

<p>In 2022, climate-induced unusual monsoon rains and flooding devastated most of the areas in impoverished Pakistan, killing more than 1,739 people, affecting around 33 million people and displacing nearly 8 million. The rains and floods in 2022 also caused billions of dollars of damages to the country's economy and some of the areas people who lost their homes are still living in makeshift homes.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-03 13:36:20,

<p>&ldquo;Bangladesh is a very fast growing country and Ireland is a very developed and educated country. Both sides can work very well together,&rdquo; he told UNB in an interview on Sunday.</p>
<p>He said Ireland&rsquo;s Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Simon Coveney TD is scheduled to arrive here on March 17 and will have a number of meetings to discuss ways to strengthen the relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are honored that Minister Simon is coming to Bangladesh. This has also been supported by my Ambassador (Ambassador of Ireland to India Kevin Kelly) in Delhi. I think this is a long overdue visit,&rdquo; Masud said.</p>
<p>Coveney is likely to meet Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud, Industries Minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun and State Minister for Commerce Ahasanul Islam Titu.</p>

<p>He will also attend a reception marking St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the National Day of Ireland and the official opening of 'the Honorary Consulate of Ireland in Bangladesh' during his visit.</p>
<p>The Irish minister is likely to attend a dialogue on Bangladesh-Ireland relations during his stay in Dhaka.</p>
<p>Bangladesh and Ireland have been enjoying excellent bilateral relations since Ireland&rsquo;s recognition of Bangladesh in early 1972.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the 1st time Ireland has appointed someone in Bangladesh. I am proud and excited to work with both sides to enhance the relations,&rdquo; said Masud, who is also Cosmos Group Deputy Managing Director.</p>
<p>Responding to a question, he said during the last 26 years the exports of Bangladesh to Ireland have increased at an annualized rate of 16.3%, from $6.89M in 1995 to $347M in 2021. &ldquo;So, it has been a big jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Masud said Ireland is now seen as one of Europe's leading tech hubs, and it is also home to the EMEA headquarters for a large array of big tech companies, including Hubspot and Indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ireland could take skilled professionals from Bangladesh in the IT sector. Bangladesh can also become an IT hub with the support of Ireland. Bangladesh has a young population and is highly trainable,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Masud said both countries are doing well in the pharmaceutical sector. &ldquo;We can definitely look into this,&rdquo; he said, adding that garments are already being exported from Bangladesh to Ireland and it is increasing every year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said concentrated milk is being exported from Ireland to Bangladesh. &ldquo;We can bring cows from Ireland and we can bring them here to breed. Malt extract and scrap iron is also being brought to Bangladesh from Ireland. These are the areas we can explore immediately,&rdquo; Masud suggested.</p>
<p>He said there is huge potential to have collaboration in the education sector and two sides can explore opportunities to set up branches of Ireland&rsquo;s educational institutions here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ireland is a nice place to study,&rdquo; he said, adding that there are some top ranking universities in Ireland.</p>
<p>Sharing his feelings over his appointment, Masud said, &ldquo;I am proud and excited to work with both sides to enhance the relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great feeling and very hard to describe. Definitely, this is a feeling of happiness and feeling of excitement and emotion, something I have been trying to achieve,&rdquo; Masud said.</p>
<p>Referring to his father Honorary Consul of Romania Enayetullah Khan, he said he also grew up in that culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always had a wish that I could become Honorary Consul of a country and work towards enhancing ties with Bangladesh,&rdquo; he said, hoping that he can be successful in his assignment.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-03 16:00:15,

<p>""WFP and its partners remain committed to advancing these proven interventions to help vulnerable communities be better prepared for and protected against the adverse impacts of climate-related hazards,&rdquo; said Riccardo Suppo.</p>
<p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), in partnership with the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) of Bangladesh and the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), last week conducted a lesson learnt workshop on Strengthening Early Warning Systems and Forecast-Based Early Action in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>During the workshop, WFP, MoDMR, and EU Humanitarian presented the preliminary findings of a study on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of early warning systems for both flash floods and storm surge floods in disaster-prone areas; and the success of WFP's forecast-based cash assistance to 6,000 households in Teknaf, Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, was also highlighted.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, with generous EU humanitarian funding to its forecast-based financing initiative, WFP has provided timely and crucial support to families in Teknaf, aiding in their preparation for imminent floods and expediting recovery efforts in the aftermath.</p>
<p>This initiative has contributed positively to the Government's disaster risk management endeavours, said WFP in media release on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project holds significant importance as it served as a testing ground for technical solutions essential for enhancing the implementation of shock-responsive social protection in Bangladesh. We are eager to continue supporting the Government of Bangladesh, particularly through MoDMR, in this area for the long term,&rdquo; said Anna Orlandini, Head of Office, EU Humanitarian in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The workshop emphasized the importance of continued capacity-building in technical areas, such as multi-hazard forecasting and early warning systems, as well as collaboration between national and international organizations to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters through proactive measures.</p>

China and Myanmar likely to be high on the agenda when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Australia,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Asia/131936,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/9170985.webp,World,Asia,China and Myanmar likely to be high on the agenda when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Australia,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:4508:""<p>An increasingly assertive China and a humanitarian crisis in Myanmar are likely to be high on the agenda when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Australia for a rare summit this week.</p>
<p>The ASEAN-Australia Special Summit that starts in Melbourne on Monday marks 50 years since Australia became the first official partner of the Asian bloc.</p>
<p>Leaders of nine of the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations are expected to attend the three-day summit, with Myanmar excluded from political representation over its failure to stem violence in that country since a military junta seized control in 2021. East Timor&rsquo;s leader has been invited as an official ASEAN observer and Australian Prime Anthony Albanese invited his New Zealand counterpart to Melbourne to meet regional leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Australia sees ASEAN at the center of a stable, peaceful and prosperous region,&rdquo; Albanese said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strengthening our relationship ensures our shared future prosperity and security,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Australia has hosted ASEAN leaders once before in Sydney in 2018. The leaders issued a statement with the host country then that called for a code of conduct covering the contested waters of the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly assertive over its competing territorial claims with a number of ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>Australia and the Philippines, an ASEAN member, conducted joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea for the first time in November last year.</p>
<p>Also in November, Australia proposed to ASEAN members that they declare in a joint statement at the end of the Melbourne summit their support for the 2016 arbitration ruling in The Hague in favor of the Philippines that invalidated Beijing&rsquo;s vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, Australian Broadcasting Corp said in December. China has rejected that ruling.</p>
<p>Other ASEAN countries with territorial claims in conflict with China are Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>China's increasingly assertive posture in the South China Sea and violence in Myanmar topped a meeting of ASEAN diplomats in January in Laos, the group's poorest nation, which has taken over the bloc's rotating leadership this year.</p>
<p>International Crisis Group's Asia program deputy director Huong Le Thu, who is attending the summit in Australia, said ASEAN has always been divided over how to approach China, with each member nation maintaining a unique bilateral relationship with the economic giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the commonality of one approach being feasible. They are working out the best way to manage this power asymmetry that they have with China,&rdquo; Le Thu said.</p>
<p>The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar that hangs over the summit challenges ASEAN&rsquo;s credibility as an organization, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It poses the question for its existence in the first place: why the countries&rsquo; governments in the region get together and what is the purpose of this intergovernmental institution if it cannot act on the internal crisis that effects its own organization and the region?&rdquo; Le Thu said.</p>
<p>Around 200 protesters, mostly from the Myanmar diaspora, demonstrated outside the summit on Monday morning demanding the restoration of democracy in Myanmar and that ASEAN not engage with the country&rsquo;s military leaders.</p>
<p>Australia, as the summit host, is focused on maritime cooperation, economic ties, climate change and clean energy.</p>
<p>Melissa Conley Tyler, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy and Defense Dialogue think tank, expects leaders will focus on what they share in common rather than their differences on issues such as China and Myanmar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The focus is very much going to be on how do Australia and the ASEAN countries work together to create a region where we want to live?&rdquo; said Conley Tyler, who is attending the summit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myanmar is a continuing issue, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;ll be a focus. I feel the focus will be all positive, very future-oriented, talking about what we can do together and building that sense of excitement and momentum,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>ASEAN members include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and they have a combined population of more than 650 million and GDP of more than $3 trillion.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-04 08:34:13,
Tractor protests threaten to drive the EU's green farming policies into a ditch,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Europe/131558,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/4351870.webp,World,Europe,Tractor protests threaten to drive the EU's green farming policies into a ditch,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:6602:""<p>It was the puddles of green sludge left by the tires of massive tractors in western Belgium&rsquo;s industrial farmlands that drew the attention of biological engineer Ineke Maes.</p>
<p>The slime was destructive algae, the result of the excess of chemicals used by farmers to boost their crops, but at a high cost to nature. Maes had hoped the European Union&rsquo;s environmental policies would start to make a fundamental difference by improving exhausted soils.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, some of those tractors moved off the land and onto the roads, blocking major cities and economic lifelines from Warsaw to Madrid and from Athens to Brussels. Farmers were demanding the reversal of some of the most progressive measures in the world to counter climate change and protect biodiversity, arguing that the rules were harming their livelihoods and strangling them with red tape.</p>
<p>And the impact has been stunning.</p>
<p>The farmers' protests affected the daily lives of people across the 27-nation bloc, costing businesses tens of millions of euros in transportation delays. The disruption triggered knee jerk reactions from politicians at national and EU level: they committed to rolling back policies, some of them years in the making, on everything from the use of pesticides to limiting the amount of manure that could be spread on fields.</p>
<p>To environmentalists like Maes, who works for the Belgian Better Environment Federation umbrella group, it would almost be laughable if it were not so depressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the environmental movement, we joke that we should get tractors ourselves to make a point. Then we would be competing fair and square. The purpose should be that we get negotiations, and that we get a deal through democratic process &mdash; the rules, you know,"" she said. Reasoned arguments, she says, have been drowned out by the rumble of tractor engines.</p>
<p>And there's no end in sight.</p>
<p>After hundreds of tractors disrupted the EU summit in Brussels early this month at a volume that kept some leaders awake at night, farmers plan to return on Monday. They intend to be there when agriculture ministers discuss an emergency item on the agenda &mdash; the simplification of agricultural rules and a decrease in checks at farms that environmentalists fear could amount to a further weakening of standards.</p>
<p>The political noise level from the tractors &mdash; not to mention the loads of manure dumped outside official buildings &mdash; does get through, officials said. &ldquo;That puts a bit more pressure on the ministers inside. So I would believe that ministers will be a bit more &mdash; insisting to have concrete results,&rdquo; said a high-level EU official, who asked not to be identified because the meeting has yet to take place.</p>
<p>It is this attitude that drives the environmental lobby and NGOs to distraction: knowing that scientific arguments are too often no match for the rule of the street. As a result, the EU's flagship Green Deal, that aims to make the continent carbon-neutral by 2050, is under threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really should not lose that long-term view, that vision of the future when you are working on policy,&rdquo; said Maes. &ldquo;You should not respond to the issues of the day by simply scrapping very important rules that have been seriously discussed, considered, that have been included in environmental impact reports and so on &mdash; and that have also been democratically approved in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet ahead of Monday's farm protest and meeting of agriculture ministers, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, for many the most powerful EU politician, insisted that she &ldquo;remains fully committed to delivering solutions to ease the pressure currently felt by our hard-working farming women and men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Von der Leyen's change in emphasis comes ahead of the June 6-9 elections, when a good showing by her Christian Democrat group, the European People's Party, will be key to keeping her at the helm of the all-powerful Commission. As her party has swayed toward putting farmers and industry first, so has she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a bit difficult putting a pin on Mrs. von der Leyen,&rdquo; said Jutta Paulus, a Green member of the European Parliament. ""She started off in 2019 being a climate and environment champion, more or less saying, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need the Greens anymore, we are green ourselves.&rsquo; And now she says: &lsquo;Well industry called me and they are worried. So I have to do something.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the wake of the tractor protests, action came fast and furious.</p>
<p>Early this month, von der Leyen's Commission shelved an important anti-pesticide proposal, insisting &ldquo;a different approach is needed.&rdquo; She also allowed farmers to continue using some land they had been required to keep fallow to promote biodiversity. And the proposals on the table for Monday's meeting about simplifying paperwork go in the same direction.</p>
<p>At the same time, a nature restoration law which was seen as another element in the Green Deal aspiration has already been watered down to appease farmers before it goes to a final legislative vote next Tuesday.</p>
<p>And at a national level, politicians have been bending the same way, from France to Spain and Belgium.</p>

<p>Flanders, in northern Belgium, has already relaxed its policy on the use of manure which was intended to limit emissions of nitrates that can harm water quality. Under pressure from multinational food manufacturers, whose processing plants dwarf even the biggest family farms in western Belgium, farmers are likely to stick with the industrial methods that exhaust soils and pollute waterways, Maes fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is mind-boggling that this whole process is now grinding to a halt,&rdquo; she said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-26 08:38:22,2024-02-26 09:19:42

<p>The meeting in Nairobi is the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, and governments, civil society groups, scientists and the private sector are attending.</p>
<p>“None of us live on an island. We live on planet Earth, and we are all connected,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, which is leading the process, told The Associated Press ahead of the talks. “The only way we can solve some of these problems is by talking together.”</p>
<p>At the meeting, member states discuss a raft of draft resolutions on a range of issues that the assembly adopts upon consensus. If a proposal is adopted, it sets the stage for countries to implement what’s been agreed on.</p>
<p>In the last round of talks in 2022, also in Nairobi, governments adopted 14 resolutions, including to create a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution globally. Andersen described it then as the most significant environmental multilateral deal since the Paris Agreement to limit global warming.</p>

<p>For this year’s talks, countries have submitted 20 draft resolutions for discussion, including on how best to restore degraded lands, combat dust storms and reduce the environmental impact of metal and mineral mining.</p>
<p>But with countries having different priorities, it’s often hard to get consensus on the draft resolutions. However, Andersen said, there’s generally “a forward movement” on all draft resolutions for this year's meeting, known as UNEA-6.</p>
<p>With this meeting's focus on multilateralism, UNEP wants to build on past agreements it led between governments, such as the Minamata Convention to put controls on mercury and the Montreal Protocol to heal the hole in the ozone layer, Andersen said.</p>

<p>Björn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, thinks there'll be slow progress on more complex issues such as financing around chemicals and waste.</p>
<p>Beeler also expects strong opposition on a draft resolution that wants to phase out the use of highly hazardous pesticides. The draft resolution, which was submitted by Ethiopia and is co-sponsored by Uruguay, aims to create a global alliance of U.N. bodies like UNEP, the World Health Organization and the International Labor Organization.</p>
<p>“If this does go through, it would be very significant because it would be the first time ever to see global movement on highly hazardous pesticides,” said Beeler, who is attending the talks.</p>
<p>UNEP anticipates more than 70 government ministers and 3,000 delegates at the talks.</p>
<p>“What we should expect at UNEA-6 is decision makers looking into the horizon, being aware of what is it that’s coming to us that could potentially damage our planet, and taking preemptive action to prevent this,” said Andersen.</p>

<p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Representative in Bangladesh Dr Jiaoqun Shi said information of the National Forest Inventory will be used to complete international reporting as well as strengthening the country&rsquo;s resource monitoring system.</p>
<p>""This will help building a strong information system for the forests. FAO continues to support Bangladesh and its people in protecting their natural resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations organized the inauguration programme of the 2nd National Forest Inventory of Bangladesh jointly with the Forest Department of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Dr Farhina Ahmed, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bangladesh attended the event chaired by Md Amir Hosain Chowdhury, Chief Conservator of Forests.</p>
<p>National Forest Inventory will take place across the country by the Bangladesh Forest Department under the technical assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; it is supported by the World Bank under the Sustainable Forests and Livelihoods (SUFAL) Project.</p>
<p>Bangladesh will conduct national-level forest inventory to collect the biophysical and socioeconomic data across the country. Identifying the status of the forest resources and their dependency will pave the way for better management of forest resources, FAO said on Monday.</p>
<p>The event brings all relevant national stakeholders and shares the process and technological aspects used in this inventory.</p>
<p>State-of-the-art methodologies in forest monitoring under this extended project, around 1 858 sample plots in forests will be visited to assess the net forest resources.</p>
<p>Around 6 400 households will be surveyed to enumerate the communities' dependency on forest resources.</p>
<p>Advanced tools and technologies will be introduced to maintain higher accuracy and consistency of the National Information System.</p>
<p>Bangladesh will be the first country in Southeast Asia to use these technologies for the forest inventory at the national level.</p>
<p>The main objective of the project is to strengthen the country&rsquo;s existing National Forest Management System and increase precision in forest monitoring, using state-of-the-art technical methodologies.</p>
<p>Representatives from various entities including the officials of the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), officials from the Forest Department and Department of Environment, and other pertinent Ministries, Divisions, and Agencies participated in the event.</p>
<p>National-level natural resource planners, multiple government agencies, universities, and both national and international development partners and representatives from relevant NGOs, civil society organizations (CSOs), the private sector, research/academic institutions, and stakeholders from the project's target geographies were also present.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-26 14:11:48,

FAO supports Bangladesh in strengthening pesticide regulations,Kazi Farzana Haque,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Foreign Affairs/131642,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6513594.webp,Bangladesh,Foreign Affairs,FAO supports Bangladesh in strengthening pesticide regulations,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5022:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has officially handed over its recommendations on the pesticide rules to the Department of Agricultural Extension under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Representatives from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change participated in a workshop held on Tuesday on collaboration in relevant component of the projects.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saso Martinov, Senior Technical Advisor, FAO Bangladesh and Dr Fahmida Khanom, Additional Secretary (Development) of&nbsp; the ministry participated&nbsp; in the event.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&nbsp; was chaired by Ashraf Uddin, Director, Plant Protection Wing, Department of Agricultural Extension.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The government of Bangladesh, in collaboration with FAO, is taking crucial steps to update the Pesticide Rules under the Pesticide Act of 2018, prioritizing public health and environmental protection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This collaborative effort aims to incorporate international best legal practices into the pesticide regulations and ensure the safe and responsible use of these chemicals in the country. The initiative is done under the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) project that is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saso Martinov, Senior Technical Advisor, FAO stated that, &ldquo;This is an important step in managing pesticides that are used in agriculture in Bangladesh. FAO team has handed over its recommendation on the pesticide rules today and will continue to support the Government of Bangladesh in its efforts to reduce the risks of pesticides following FAO&rsquo;s 4 Betters including a better life and a better environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dr Fahmida Khanom, Additional Secretary (Development), MoEFCC highlighted FAO&rsquo;s support in Bangladesh's achievement of becoming free from DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and said &ldquo;The government now wants to focus heavily on proper handling and recycling of toxic pesticide containers and the recommendations will work as a buffer for future activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One key focus area of the Pesticide Rules is the transparent and comprehensive pesticide registration process, overseen by the Director of the Plant Protection Wing of the Department of Agricultural Extension under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A great majority of citizens of Bangladesh rely on agriculture for food security.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Improper pesticide use can lead to residues exceeding safe limits on food crops, posing health risks to consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, unregulated pesticide use can harm beneficial insects, pollute water sources, and contaminate soil, jeopardizing biodiversity and ecosystem health. Stringent registration enables evaluation of potential environmental impacts as well as risks to human health before allowing pesticides into the market for consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">FAO Recommendations aim to implement more strict measures to prevent the infiltration of highly hazardous pesticides into the market.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This includes rigorous assessments of potential risks to human health and the environment before granting registration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The initiative prioritizes safe and responsible pesticide waste disposal. FAO Recommendations would incorporate robust regulations to ensure proper collection, transportation, and treatment of pesticide waste, minimizing the risk of environmental contamination.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recognizing the environmental impact of pesticide packaging, the project also provides guidance on its management in line with the Environment Conservation Act of 1995 and the Solid Waste Management Rules of 2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This will promote environmentally responsible packaging practices and contribute to a cleaner and healthier Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Implementing the updated Pesticide Rules requires concrete action.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A nationwide collection program for pesticide containers supported by FAO, coupled with awareness campaigns and incentives, will ensure responsible disposal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Training inspectors and empowering local authorities will strengthen enforcement, also engaging farmers through education programmes promoting safe handling and application, protecting themselves and the environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These crucial steps would pave the way for a healthier Bangladesh where responsible pesticide use safeguards public health and the environment.</p>

<p>The global event will take place on March 1-3, 2024, under the auspices of Tayyip Erdogan, President of the Republic of T&uuml;rkiye, and on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of T&uuml;rkiye.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister will be visiting T&uuml;rkiye at the invitation of his Turkish counterpart and is expected to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the Forum, a senior official told UNB.</p>
<p>Turkish Ambassador to Bangladesh Ramis Şen recently met Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud and highlighted the Antalya Diplomacy Forum.</p>
<p>The Ambassador hoped that Foreign Minister Hasan will actively join the Forum.</p>
<p>In its third edition, the Antalya Diplomacy Forum will gather heads of states and governments, ministers, diplomats, business leaders, academics, think-tankers, and youth and media representatives for an all-encompassing debate.</p>
<p>The overarching theme of this year&rsquo;s Forum will be &ldquo;Advancing Diplomacy in Times of Turmoil&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It aims to serve as a thorough reflection and the means for searching a peaceful way out of the turbulent period our world is going through.</p>
<p>Ongoing wars, acts of terrorism, irregular migration, rise of xenophobia and Islamophobia, unforeseen risks of AI, climate change, natural disasters, pandemics and widening socioeconomic gaps form a non-exhaustive list of global challenges.</p>
<p>The erosion and subsequently the loss of trust in the rules-based international order is also a worrying trend, undermining the predictability of the environment in which states operate.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the world is going through a period of several turmoils and these challenges may also act as agents leading to structural changes in the global political, economic and security landscape.</p>
<p>Moreover, as one third of the world&rsquo;s population is heading to the polls in 2024, many questions about the impact of elections on pressing international issues as well as concerns on AI manipulated disinformation and fake news will be on the international agenda.</p>
<p>How do we make better use of diplomacy to tackle global challenges in the current state of affairs?</p>
<p>The answer certainly lies in the adoption of a novel understanding of diplomacy, beyond its essential and traditional framework of dialogue.</p>
<p>For that purpose, the host country said, the Antalya Diplomacy Forum will once again provide its distinguished participants an interactive and thought-provoking platform to address the challenging issues shaping the global and regional agendas, and to discuss innovative tools to advance diplomacy in times of turmoil.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-28 22:04:06,
"Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors, genuine willingness keys to take Dhaka-Washington ties to next stage",Farid Hossain,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6506592.webp,Special,,"Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors, genuine willingness keys to take Dhaka-Washington ties to next stage","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:2:{i:0;s:5693:""<p>Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors and a genuine willingness to broaden ties in new areas will drive forward the Bangladesh-US relations to the next level leaving behind pre-election political differences between the two countries, experts opine viewing post-polls relations.</p>
<p>“Both countries have long and old ties in every aspect of statecraft and bilateral relations. The new chapter denotes that these two countries would deepen their engagement beyond the much-debated political differences,” Prof Shahab Enam Khan of Jahangirnagar University’s Department of International Relations told UNB this week.</p>
<p>A senior US government delegation visited Bangladesh last week with an agenda that included strengthening diplomatic ties and advancing shared interests in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The delegation comprised Eileen Laubacher, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for South Asia, US National Security Council (NSC); Michael Schiffer, USAID Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Asia; and Afreen Akhter, US Department of State Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Their discussions also focused on climate change, trade, the Rohingya refugee crisis, and labor rights. The delegation met with senior officials, business executives, civil society organisations, and top opposition leaders.</p>
<p>Prof Shahab, who is also executive director and CEO at Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs, assumes the issues of Bangladesh’s national security and the Indo-Pacific agenda coincide with the US ones.</p>
<p>Hence, he thinks, the bilateral relations will get new momentum in defense, security, non-traditional security, and human security issues.</p>
<p>“Myanmar, too, is a wake-up call here. This further gives me a sense that the US would not see Bangladesh through any third-country prism,” said the international affairs expert.</p>
<p>Instead, he thinks, both countries may synchronise their mutual interests in the coming days. “Bangladesh, after all, has been the most dependable country for the superpowers as it comes with no fractured ties with the regional neighbours or any hyped-up political or security narratives.”</p>
<p>Prof Shahab said these two factors make Bangladesh a regional security guarantor needed to keep the Indo-Pacific region stable.</p>
<p><strong>A New Chapter and Priorities</strong></p>
<p>Asked about the priority areas in opening a new chapter in their relations with Bangladesh, US Embassy spokesperson Haynes Mahoney said Bangladesh is an Indo-Pacific partner and the United States is Bangladesh’s largest source of foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>“We are committed to working together to ensure the Indo-Pacific region remains free, open, peaceful, and secure. We also engage with Bangladesh on broader sets of priorities,” he told UNB.</p>
<p>“As President Biden has stated, we will look at ways to build on our long-standing partnership to improve economic growth, mitigate climate change, and to invest in people so they have opportunities to lead healthier and more prosperous lives,” Haynes added.</p>
<p>The US is pleased to see Bangladesh’s Indo-Pacific outlook, which he thinks “really mirrors” what they are trying to do in terms of economic investment, working with Bangladesh on climate change, and building out security and defense cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is, of course, one of the largest UN Peacekeeping contributors, and we are very pleased to support that effort, Haynes said.</p>
<p>Highlighting economic opportunities, he said leveraging their investments in development through the private sector and engaging youth are areas that they are increasingly focused on.</p>
<p>“We are bringing business leaders and youth together to identify ways to equip young people with more marketable job-skills – creating a more talented workforce with the skills needed to drive companies towards greater success and help Bangladesh be more competitive in the global marketplace,” he said.</p>
<p>The US Embassy spokesperson said they continue to identify ways to strengthen the economic and trade ties between the two countries, while building on our work together to accelerate socio-economic development so that people in all corners of the country have equitable opportunities to live healthier and more prosperous lives.</p>
<p>“We are looking for ways in which we can collaborate with Bangladesh to modernize its military and be able to invest in maritime domain awareness to be able to understand what is on your coastal borders, what is coming in by air, land, and sea,"" he said.</p>
<p><strong>Issues around GSOMIA and ACSA</strong></p>
<p>Asked about the progress regarding the two proposed agreements - General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) and the Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), Haynes said GSOMIA is being considered between the US and Bangladesh armed forces as the two sides continue to explore opportunities for “more substantive and deeper” engagement.</p>
<p>The agreement is effectively a commitment that each side will effectively secure any information or sensitive materials received from the other, he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he said, ACSA facilitate the exchange of logistical support between partner militaries and enhance the opportunities for meaningful engagement.</p>
<p>Although there are no discussions at present between the US and Bangladesh about pursuing an ACSA, this could change in the future should the two sides determine it offers sufficient benefit, Haynes said.</p>
<p> </p>"";i:1;s:4595:""<p><strong>Myanmar Situation and Its Impacts</strong></p>
<p>“Obviously, we are very concerned, and we are following the developments in Burma [Myanmar] closely. The ongoing clashes in Burma [Myanmar] are deeply troubling. This is a significant concern not only for the region but also for the international community,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>He said the ongoing crisis in Myanmar is a pressing issue, and the United States has contributed more than two billion dollars in humanitarian assistance to this crisis, including approximately $500 million in Myanmar.</p>
<p>“It is essential to address the root causes of the crisis, promote stability, and work towards finding a sustainable and humane resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>They emphasised the need for diplomatic efforts and international cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the situation in Myanmar, aiming for a “comprehensive and inclusive” approach to ensure the well-being of the affected populations and regional stability.</p>
<p>“We also recognize the need to continue support for civilians displaced by the conflict in Burma, including both internally displaced people in Burma and Rohingya refugees residing in Bangladesh,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the United States provided an additional $87 million to continue providing food and nutrition assistance to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, which helped raise the monthly food rations for refugees to $10 per person per month.</p>
<p>“That was an important step to make sure they are getting enough food and nutrition to stay healthy. We also continue to provide support to Bangladeshi host communities through a range of multisectoral interventions, including job-skills and business literacy training to help people improve their livelihoods,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p><strong>A Positive Shift</strong></p>
<p>South Asia Institute Director at the Wilson Center and writer of Foreign Policy's weekly South Asia Brief Michael Kugelman has said US-Bangladesh relations have taken a more positive turn after a Bangladesh election that the US described as not free or fair.</p>
<p>He explained why, and also argued that this shift is not actually as sharp as it seems and noted that the visit came amid an apparent shift in bilateral relations, especially in terms of tone and messaging.</p>
<p>In the months ahead of Bangladesh’s Jan. 7 elections, the United States took strong steps to promote human rights and democracy, including through sanctions, visa restrictions, and public criticism.</p>
<p>Though that US State Department characterised the vote as not free or fair, US President Joe Biden sent a letter to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that welcomed the “next chapter” in the US-Bangladesh relationship; it did not mention rights or democracy.</p>
<p>During the U.S. delegation’s visit this week, Bangladeshi officials, including Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud, underscored the fresh start theme.</p>
<p>Salman F Rahman, an advisor to PM Hasina, said the “election is now a thing of the past.” Messaging from both sides was warm and effusive, with plenty of references to the partnership’s strength.</p>
<p>What accounts for the turnaround? Michael Kugelman said one possibility is Washington’s desire to distance itself from the highly charged political environment in Dhaka.</p>
<p>“The more U.S. officials publicly opine about human rights and democracy in Bangladesh, the more they risk getting dragged into it,” he wrote in Foreign Policy’s South Asia Brief.</p>
<p>He said strategic considerations are also likely at play and the previous US approach effectively gave Beijing and Moscow an advantage in Dhaka and rankled New Delhi.</p>
<p>“Geopolitical factors also play a role in the new US approach. The conflict in neighboring Myanmar is intensifying, and Bangladesh hosts hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees but seeks to repatriate them,” Kugelman said.</p>
<p>Washington wants to ensure that it has sufficient diplomatic space to engage with Dhaka on these sensitive issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kugelman said with US foreign-policy attention increasingly focused on instability in the Middle East, the United States wants to reduce diplomatic headaches elsewhere.</p>
<p>“The relationship’s tone and messaging are emphasizing positivity and potential, not public pressure. Ultimately, this reflects that, for now, the United States has concluded that smooth relations with Bangladesh are a strategic imperative,” he said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:2:{i:0;s:25:""news/details/4432665.webp"";i:1;s:25:""news/details/6120685.webp"";}s:8:""captions"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}}",2024-03-01 15:54:40,2024-03-01 16:01:35

<p>He said the private sector is not interested in Climate Adaptation financing. They need to be incentivized and motivated to invest in adaptation activities.</p>
<p>The minister was addressing a session entitled 'Ensuring Public and Private Financial Flows Aligned with Environmental Goals to Close the Massive Funding' at the 6th United Nations Environment Conference being held in Kenya&rsquo;s Nairobi on Friday.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said the leadership of the government of the world made pledges in the past in which promises were unkept. The environmental goals even become stiffer and the resources we need are going to be far greater. Urgency and delivering of commitment not just signing, pledges and making landmark resolutions but implementing is a must.</p>
<p>Environment Minister said Bangladesh formulated a plan for transitioning from vulnerability to resilience and ultimately to prosperity. It requires a significant investment, estimated at nearly $80 billion. Bangladesh, with its abundant offshore wind and nature-based solutions, has outlined a plan for climate finance.</p>

These include the Land Zoning Project and the Bangladesh Digital Survey Program. These initiatives will reduce environmental damage in the country by encouraging and enforcing sustainable land use practices, he said.</p>
<p>The minister said this while inaugurating the two-day 2nd International Conference on Environment at Journalist Liaquat Ali Auditorium of Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Academic Building of Khulna University (KU) on Saturday. The theme of the summit is 'Time for Nature and Natural Resource Management'.</p>
<p>Khulna University Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr. Mahmood Hossain presided over the inaugural function while Professor Emeritus of BRAC University and climate change expert Prof. Dr. Ainun Nishat, Pro-Vice Chancellor of Khulna University Prof. Dr. Mosummath Hosna Ara and Dean of the Life Science School Prof. Dr. Abul Kalam Azad were also present.</p>

<p>The Land Minister said that under the land zoning project, they will prepare a digital map and land use plan based on Mouza and Plot division. This includes categorizing land into specific uses such as agricultural, residential, commercial, tourism, and industrial development based on the quality assessment of the land.</p>
<p>The minister said that by using land zoning project data and maps, unplanned urbanization, housing, house construction, development activities, and industrial road construction will be prevented. Environmental protection and production of food crops will be continued by maintaining the class or nature of the land, he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The land minister also said through this, planned and optimum use of land including protection of agricultural land, forests, hills, rivers, canals, and water bodies will be ensured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said the land zoning project will prove to be invaluable to &lsquo;Nature and Natural Resource Management'.</p>
<p>Earlier, paying tribute to the memory of the Father of the Nation, the Land Minister said, after victory in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took various steps to combat pollution and conserve biodiversity in newly independent Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The minister said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina realized that it would not be possible to achieve a Smart, Sonar Bangla &mdash; to materialize the dream of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman &mdash; without taking sustainable measures. She has taken robust policies and plans to protect Bangladesh from the adverse effects of climate change and global warming and create a pollution-free environment in the country. In 2011, she took the initiative to bring the conservation and development of environment and biodiversity as a constitutional obligation and adopted the long-term delta plan.</p>

<p>Plenary Speaker of the conference, Dr. Ainun Nishat said the issue of climate change is now a harsh reality. It is clear that it now rains during Hemanta (dry season), and winter is not as cold as it should be. Besides, salinity in the Khulna region has increased significantly. Dr. Ainun Nishat stressed that food security has now become a major concern for most countries globally due to climate change. He underscored the need for implementing changes in the agricultural management system in Bangladesh. Moreover, he stressed the need to ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of ecosystems and the benefits derived from them.</p>
<p>Thanking the Land Minister and other guests, Vice-Chancellor Prof. Dr. Mahmud Hossain said that diverse natural resources are essential for sustainable ecosystems, which can contribute to health, livelihood, and shelter. He stressed the need for research on nature and natural resource management for food security and poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that 245 local and foreign experts and scientists from Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates, Poland, Italy, and Germany are expected to participate physically and virtually in this conference. A total of 183 research articles, comprising 128 oral presentations, 48 poster presentations, and 6 keynote papers, are scheduled to be presented during the conference. At the conclusion of the conference, it is anticipated that a set of recommendations will be prepared.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-02 16:13:05,

<p>Bangladesh urged the global community to urgently change the definition of climate migrants and refugees to bring it in line with the UN definition of migrants and refugees.</p>
<p>He mentioned that life thrives only on this planet as far as we know.</p>
<p>At the first panel discussion of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum held in Antalya, T&uuml;rkiye on Saturday, the Foreign Minister spoke on global climate change, climate migrant and climate refugee issues.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers of Malaysia and Bangladesh, State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, and Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Vietnam discussed various aspects of the &ldquo;Building Asia-Pacific Regional Architecture: The Challenge of Unmatching Interests&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hasan mentioned that like many small and island nations, Bangladesh has become one of the worst sufferers of climate change and global warming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire coastal area of Bangladesh is at the risk of inundation due to the sea level rise and over the last three decades, rise of greenhouse gases, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""And this phenomenon is constantly causing climate migration. The issue is now so real that Bangladesh urgently needs the world community to change the definition of climate migrants and refugees,"" he said.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister mentioned that while the country and many environmental scientists have been focusing on the issue for many years, many world leaders have not believed in it until lately it has become evident to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Yet the rich countries, the major contributors to global warming, are doing very little to address the issue and protect our environment,"" Hasan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are local issues that make the impact global.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bangladesh, as one of the worst sufferers of this harsh reality, urged all activists and leaders to accept the importance of changing the definition of climate migrants and refugees and devise an acceptable definition of it to protect the victims and the future generations, said the Foreign Minister.&nbsp;</p>

Fishermen return to crab collection in Sundarbans after a 2-month ban,Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/2110111.webp,Environment,,Fishermen return to crab collection in Sundarbans after a 2-month ban,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:2890:""<p>Fishermen have resumed collecting crabs in the Sundarbans following the conclusion of a two-month government-enforced ban designed to safeguard the breeding season of crabs.</p>
<p>The ban, aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the crab population, ended last Thursday at midnight, with fishermen from coastal regions such as Mongla, Rampal, and Dakope seen entering the forest on Sunday with necessary equipment for crab collection.</p>
<p>The hiatus, necessitated by the breeding season of crabs in January and February, saw the issuance of pass-permits by the forest department halted. With the ban lifted, permits are once again being distributed, allowing the fishermen to legally collect crabs from the Sundarbans' extensive network of rivers and canals.</p>

<p>Spanning 6,017 sqkm in Bangladesh, including 1,874.1 sqkm of aquatic areas, the Sundarbans are home to 450 rivers and canals, along with 14 species of crabs.</p>
<p>To protect these species, certain canals have been designated as sanctuaries, with restrictions on crab collection in canals narrower than 25 feet enforced year-round.</p>
<p>Approximately 15,000 fishermen, equipped with valid forest department passes, depend on crab collecting within the non-restricted areas of the Sundarbans for their livelihood. The annual ban, instituted following the establishment of crab export guidelines, seeks to balance economic needs with environmental conservation.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Special/sundarbans-day-in-southwestern-region-on-feb-14-a-clarion-call-to-love-save-the-forest/130765"">Sundarbans Day in southwestern region on Feb 14; a clarion call to love, save the forest</a></p>
<p>Anisur Rahman, a crab collector from Joymoni in Mongla, highlighted the financial hardships faced by the fishermen due to the ban, pointing out the lack of governmental assistance during this period. Despite the ban's intent, there have been reports of illegal crab collection during the breeding season, undermining conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Mihir Kumar Doe, the forest Conservator of the Khulna region, confirmed that legal crab collection could resume in designated areas from March 2, with forest guards instructed to enhance patrolling to prevent illegal activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, strict guidelines have been put in place for the transportation of crabs, with divisional actions promised against violators.</p>
<p>This move to resume crab collection comes as a relief to many fishermen reliant on the trade, while the forest department remains vigilant against practices that could harm the Sundarbans' ecological balance.</p>

<p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), in partnership with the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) of Bangladesh and the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), last week conducted a lesson learnt workshop on Strengthening Early Warning Systems and Forecast-Based Early Action in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>During the workshop, WFP, MoDMR, and EU Humanitarian presented the preliminary findings of a study on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of early warning systems for both flash floods and storm surge floods in disaster-prone areas; and the success of WFP's forecast-based cash assistance to 6,000 households in Teknaf, Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, was also highlighted.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, with generous EU humanitarian funding to its forecast-based financing initiative, WFP has provided timely and crucial support to families in Teknaf, aiding in their preparation for imminent floods and expediting recovery efforts in the aftermath.</p>
<p>This initiative has contributed positively to the Government's disaster risk management endeavours, said WFP in media release on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project holds significant importance as it served as a testing ground for technical solutions essential for enhancing the implementation of shock-responsive social protection in Bangladesh.

<p>The ASEAN-Australia Special Summit that starts in Melbourne on Monday marks 50 years since Australia became the first official partner of the Asian bloc.</p>
<p>Leaders of nine of the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations are expected to attend the three-day summit, with Myanmar excluded from political representation over its failure to stem violence in that country since a military junta seized control in 2021. East Timor&rsquo;s leader has been invited as an official ASEAN observer and Australian Prime Anthony Albanese invited his New Zealand counterpart to Melbourne to meet regional leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Australia sees ASEAN at the center of a stable, peaceful and prosperous region,&rdquo; Albanese said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strengthening our relationship ensures our shared future prosperity and security,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Australia has hosted ASEAN leaders once before in Sydney in 2018. The leaders issued a statement with the host country then that called for a code of conduct covering the contested waters of the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly assertive over its competing territorial claims with a number of ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>Australia and the Philippines, an ASEAN member, conducted joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea for the first time in November last year.</p>
<p>Also in November, Australia proposed to ASEAN members that they declare in a joint statement at the end of the Melbourne summit their support for the 2016 arbitration ruling in The Hague in favor of the Philippines that invalidated Beijing&rsquo;s vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, Australian Broadcasting Corp said in December. China has rejected that ruling.</p>
<p>Other ASEAN countries with territorial claims in conflict with China are Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>China's increasingly assertive posture in the South China Sea and violence in Myanmar topped a meeting of ASEAN diplomats in January in Laos, the group's poorest nation, which has taken over the bloc's rotating leadership this year.</p>
<p>International Crisis Group's Asia program deputy director Huong Le Thu, who is attending the summit in Australia, said ASEAN has always been divided over how to approach China, with each member nation maintaining a unique bilateral relationship with the economic giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the commonality of one approach being feasible. They are working out the best way to manage this power asymmetry that they have with China,&rdquo; Le Thu said.</p>
<p>The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar that hangs over the summit challenges ASEAN&rsquo;s credibility as an organization, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It poses the question for its existence in the first place: why the countries&rsquo; governments in the region get together and what is the purpose of this intergovernmental institution if it cannot act on the internal crisis that effects its own organization and the region?&rdquo; Le Thu said.</p>
<p>Around 200 protesters, mostly from the Myanmar diaspora, demonstrated outside the summit on Monday morning demanding the restoration of democracy in Myanmar and that ASEAN not engage with the country&rsquo;s military leaders.</p>
<p>Australia, as the summit host, is focused on maritime cooperation, economic ties, climate change and clean energy.</p>
<p>Melissa Conley Tyler, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy and Defense Dialogue think tank, expects leaders will focus on what they share in common rather than their differences on issues such as China and Myanmar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The focus is very much going to be on how do Australia and the ASEAN countries work together to create a region where we want to live?&rdquo; said Conley Tyler, who is attending the summit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myanmar is a continuing issue, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;ll be a focus. I feel the focus will be all positive, very future-oriented, talking about what we can do together and building that sense of excitement and momentum,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>ASEAN members include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and they have a combined population of more than 650 million and GDP of more than $3 trillion.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-04 08:34:13,
Tractor protests threaten to drive the EU's green farming policies into a ditch,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Europe/131558,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/4351870.webp,World,Europe,Tractor protests threaten to drive the EU's green farming policies into a ditch,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:6602:""<p>It was the puddles of green sludge left by the tires of massive tractors in western Belgium&rsquo;s industrial farmlands that drew the attention of biological engineer Ineke Maes.</p>
<p>The slime was destructive algae, the result of the excess of chemicals used by farmers to boost their crops, but at a high cost to nature. Maes had hoped the European Union&rsquo;s environmental policies would start to make a fundamental difference by improving exhausted soils.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, some of those tractors moved off the land and onto the roads, blocking major cities and economic lifelines from Warsaw to Madrid and from Athens to Brussels. Farmers were demanding the reversal of some of the most progressive measures in the world to counter climate change and protect biodiversity, arguing that the rules were harming their livelihoods and strangling them with red tape.</p>
<p>And the impact has been stunning.</p>
<p>The farmers' protests affected the daily lives of people across the 27-nation bloc, costing businesses tens of millions of euros in transportation delays. The disruption triggered knee jerk reactions from politicians at national and EU level: they committed to rolling back policies, some of them years in the making, on everything from the use of pesticides to limiting the amount of manure that could be spread on fields.</p>
<p>To environmentalists like Maes, who works for the Belgian Better Environment Federation umbrella group, it would almost be laughable if it were not so depressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the environmental movement, we joke that we should get tractors ourselves to make a point. Then we would be competing fair and square. The purpose should be that we get negotiations, and that we get a deal through democratic process &mdash; the rules, you know,"" she said. Reasoned arguments, she says, have been drowned out by the rumble of tractor engines.</p>
<p>And there's no end in sight.</p>
<p>After hundreds of tractors disrupted the EU summit in Brussels early this month at a volume that kept some leaders awake at night, farmers plan to return on Monday. They intend to be there when agriculture ministers discuss an emergency item on the agenda &mdash; the simplification of agricultural rules and a decrease in checks at farms that environmentalists fear could amount to a further weakening of standards.</p>
<p>The political noise level from the tractors &mdash; not to mention the loads of manure dumped outside official buildings &mdash; does get through, officials said. &ldquo;That puts a bit more pressure on the ministers inside. So I would believe that ministers will be a bit more &mdash; insisting to have concrete results,&rdquo; said a high-level EU official, who asked not to be identified because the meeting has yet to take place.</p>
<p>It is this attitude that drives the environmental lobby and NGOs to distraction: knowing that scientific arguments are too often no match for the rule of the street. As a result, the EU's flagship Green Deal, that aims to make the continent carbon-neutral by 2050, is under threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really should not lose that long-term view, that vision of the future when you are working on policy,&rdquo; said Maes. &ldquo;You should not respond to the issues of the day by simply scrapping very important rules that have been seriously discussed, considered, that have been included in environmental impact reports and so on &mdash; and that have also been democratically approved in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet ahead of Monday's farm protest and meeting of agriculture ministers, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, for many the most powerful EU politician, insisted that she &ldquo;remains fully committed to delivering solutions to ease the pressure currently felt by our hard-working farming women and men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Von der Leyen's change in emphasis comes ahead of the June 6-9 elections, when a good showing by her Christian Democrat group, the European People's Party, will be key to keeping her at the helm of the all-powerful Commission. As her party has swayed toward putting farmers and industry first, so has she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a bit difficult putting a pin on Mrs. von der Leyen,&rdquo; said Jutta Paulus, a Green member of the European Parliament. ""She started off in 2019 being a climate and environment champion, more or less saying, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need the Greens anymore, we are green ourselves.&rsquo; And now she says: &lsquo;Well industry called me and they are worried. So I have to do something.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the wake of the tractor protests, action came fast and furious.</p>
<p>Early this month, von der Leyen's Commission shelved an important anti-pesticide proposal, insisting &ldquo;a different approach is needed.&rdquo; She also allowed farmers to continue using some land they had been required to keep fallow to promote biodiversity. And the proposals on the table for Monday's meeting about simplifying paperwork go in the same direction.</p>
<p>At the same time, a nature restoration law which was seen as another element in the Green Deal aspiration has already been watered down to appease farmers before it goes to a final legislative vote next Tuesday.</p>
<p>And at a national level, politicians have been bending the same way, from France to Spain and Belgium.</p>

<p>Flanders, in northern Belgium, has already relaxed its policy on the use of manure which was intended to limit emissions of nitrates that can harm water quality. Under pressure from multinational food manufacturers, whose processing plants dwarf even the biggest family farms in western Belgium, farmers are likely to stick with the industrial methods that exhaust soils and pollute waterways, Maes fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is mind-boggling that this whole process is now grinding to a halt,&rdquo; she said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-26 08:38:22,2024-02-26 09:19:42

<p>The meeting in Nairobi is the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, and governments, civil society groups, scientists and the private sector are attending.</p>
<p>“None of us live on an island. We live on planet Earth, and we are all connected,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, which is leading the process, told The Associated Press ahead of the talks. “The only way we can solve some of these problems is by talking together.”</p>
<p>At the meeting, member states discuss a raft of draft resolutions on a range of issues that the assembly adopts upon consensus. If a proposal is adopted, it sets the stage for countries to implement what’s been agreed on.</p>
<p>In the last round of talks in 2022, also in Nairobi, governments adopted 14 resolutions, including to create a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution globally. Andersen described it then as the most significant environmental multilateral deal since the Paris Agreement to limit global warming.</p>

<p>For this year’s talks, countries have submitted 20 draft resolutions for discussion, including on how best to restore degraded lands, combat dust storms and reduce the environmental impact of metal and mineral mining.</p>
<p>But with countries having different priorities, it’s often hard to get consensus on the draft resolutions. However, Andersen said, there’s generally “a forward movement” on all draft resolutions for this year's meeting, known as UNEA-6.</p>
<p>With this meeting's focus on multilateralism, UNEP wants to build on past agreements it led between governments, such as the Minamata Convention to put controls on mercury and the Montreal Protocol to heal the hole in the ozone layer, Andersen said.</p>

<p>Björn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, thinks there'll be slow progress on more complex issues such as financing around chemicals and waste.</p>
<p>Beeler also expects strong opposition on a draft resolution that wants to phase out the use of highly hazardous pesticides. The draft resolution, which was submitted by Ethiopia and is co-sponsored by Uruguay, aims to create a global alliance of U.N. bodies like UNEP, the World Health Organization and the International Labor Organization.</p>
<p>“If this does go through, it would be very significant because it would be the first time ever to see global movement on highly hazardous pesticides,” said Beeler, who is attending the talks.</p>
<p>UNEP anticipates more than 70 government ministers and 3,000 delegates at the talks.</p>
<p>“What we should expect at UNEA-6 is decision makers looking into the horizon, being aware of what is it that’s coming to us that could potentially damage our planet, and taking preemptive action to prevent this,” said Andersen.</p>

"Robi’s call drop rate lowest in the country, CEO says",Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/1899761.webp,Special,,"Robi’s call drop rate lowest in the country, CEO says","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:10063:""<p>Rajeev Sethi assumed the role of Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Robi Axiata in October 2022. Prior to this, he was associated with the mobile operator Ooredoo in Myanmar. He also served as the Chief Commercial Officer of Airtel Africa. His professional journey includes leadership roles in renowned companies like Vodafone, HP, Hutchison Telecom, and Asian Paints. An MBA specializing in marketing, finance, and operations, Sethi&rsquo;s familiarity with Bangladesh is not recent. He has previously held the position of CEO at GrameenPhone. In an exclusive interview with UNB, Sethi talked about Robi&rsquo;s growth, his experience in the telecom sector in Bangladesh and more.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Robi recorded a 16 percent leap in its revenue in FY 2023. Profits also went up by 74 percent. Can you elaborate on that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Setting records isn&rsquo;t necessarily crucial. It&rsquo;s common for expanding businesses to break their own revenue records annually. However, what stands out is Robi&rsquo;s impressive rate of business expansion in 2023. The company saw its highest revenue and profit growth in its 27-year history that year. Furthermore, Robi&rsquo;s 2023 growth outpaced all other telecom companies in Bangladesh. Based on the data available for mobile operators in the Asia and Pacific region, Robi&rsquo;s growth was unmatched.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What do you believe contributed to this success?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It&rsquo;s the outcome of persistent endeavours. We&rsquo;ve significantly enhanced our network. I can confidently state that Robi currently has the superior network for both voice calls and internet usage. This is a key factor in our success.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve simplified our internet and minute packages to be user-friendly. We&rsquo;ve strived to provide packages that cater to our subscribers&rsquo; preferences. Our branding efforts have also been successful. We&rsquo;ve launched a new branding campaign called &ldquo;Parbe tumio&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The positive business results are the culmination of all these efforts.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Why hasn&rsquo;t Robi, despite being operational since 1997, been able to generate profits at the same level as its competitors?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> There are multiple factors at play. The game is all about numbers and reach. The higher the subscriber count, the greater the revenue and profit. More subscribers translate to reduced operational costs per subscriber. Given the current state of the telecom sector, it&rsquo;s challenging for smaller operators to boost their profits.</p>
<p>Globally, various steps are taken to safeguard these smaller entities. This issue was also brought up in Bangladesh a few years back, but no effective measures were implemented. It&rsquo;s not just about the profit or loss of any single operator. If a monopoly exists in the market, the subscribers are the ones who stand to lose.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Having had experience in the telecom sector of Bangladesh, what is your evaluation of the sector&rsquo;s regulations, policies, and other rules?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> This question can be approached in several ways. One perspective is that the telecom sector in this country is an attractive investment opportunity due to the high population density, which is beneficial for establishing telecom infrastructure. A significant part of the population is young and eager for new experiences. Many homes without broadband connections present further opportunities for the telecom sector. However, the sector is burdened with extremely high taxes. For every 100 taka earned, 56 goes to the government &ndash; a rate that is double compared to neighbouring countries. The absence of a unified license to offer telecom services at various levels means that a company cannot independently provide all services and must rely on the tower company. This dependency not only increases costs but also impacts the quality of service.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: As an Indian living in Bangladesh, how would you compare the network quality of the two countries?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It really hinges on the standard of comparison. However, I can affirm that the network quality I experience in Dhaka surpasses that in Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: There are complaints from consumers in Bangladesh about the service quality. Specific issues include lack of network coverage at home and call drops. What&rsquo;s your perspective on this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It&rsquo;s common for people to voice their complaints on social media when they&rsquo;re dissatisfied with a service, rather than when they&rsquo;re content. Given the millions of calls made daily, a few call drops are inevitable due to the imperfect nature of radio waves. It&rsquo;s important to assess whether the call drop rates exceed both local and international standards. For instance, Robi&rsquo;s call drop rate is 0.3, the lowest in the country. However, we continuously strive to enhance our service. We&rsquo;re attempting to establish towers in certain challenging locations like Ukhia in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, but acquiring the necessary land for tower setup presents its own set of difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Isn&rsquo;t there also a need to augment the number of towers in Dhaka?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Definitely. We have the equipment to establish approximately 600 towers, but they&rsquo;re currently unused in our warehouse due to space constraints. We&rsquo;re in talks with regulatory bodies and tower companies. The idea of sharing towers seems promising, and we&rsquo;re exploring that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What strategies can be employed to boost internet usage in Bangladesh?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> The majority of individuals in Bangladesh access the internet via their smartphones. To boost internet usage, it&rsquo;s crucial to make smartphones more affordable; they are currently quite expensive in this country. Local firms have begun producing smartphones, and it&rsquo;s worth exploring how to reduce their prices.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: The government is discussing the implementation of high-speed 5G internet service. Are the service providers prepared, and is there a market demand for 5G?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> In terms of service providers, we are indeed prepared for 5G. However, the market readiness is a separate issue. For the average user, 5G won&rsquo;t significantly alter their experience, as it will be similar to their current internet movie-watching experience. The real need for 5G lies in the industrial and service sectors. The extent of automation in these sectors needs to be evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Why did Robi recently establish two subsidiary firms, Axentec and r-ventures?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to cater to business entities. Currently, the revenue from this sector is minimal, but it&rsquo;s expected to grow as services expand in the future. With a forward-looking approach, a new company has been established and a new CEO has been appointed. It&rsquo;s noteworthy that similar businesses have seen a significant increase in revenue in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Is Robi considering issuing additional shares in the capital market?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> This falls under the purview of the board of directors. However, to the best of my knowledge, it&rsquo;s not currently being considered.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What would you highlight as the challenges and opportunities of investing in Bangladesh?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Investors prefer a stable policy environment as it facilitates strategic planning. Abrupt alterations in government policies related to investment can cause concern among investors. The presence of a third-party dispute resolution mechanism is crucial in business, a role typically fulfilled by the court. An unbiased judicial system is a fundamental requirement for investment. If one were to select a country for investment in the telecom sector, Bangladesh would be a prime choice. The country offers numerous advantages for investment.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What is your perception of Bangladeshis after working here for an extended period of time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> I have a deep affection for Bangladesh. People here are incredibly amicable and possess a keen interest in gaining knowledge and learning. Their passion for cricket is evident. This country is brimming with untapped talent that the world is yet to discover. We conducted a talent hunt in the digital sector and were astounded by the exceptional young talents we found. Unlike me, who is in the 40 to 50 age bracket, these are young individuals aged around 25 to 30. They require an appropriate platform to showcase their abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Robi&rsquo;s Financial Facts for 2023</strong></p>
<p>Robi reported a revenue of approximately Tk 99.42 billion and a post-tax profit of Tk 3.21 billion. The total investment since the company&rsquo;s inception is Tk 380 billion. The company boasts a subscriber base of 55.7 million. It was listed on the stock market on December 24, 2020, with a share market value of Tk 31.20 and offers a cash dividend of 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Brief overview of Robi</strong></p>
<p>The Axiata Group Berhad, based in Malaysia, holds a 61.82% stake in Robi. Bharti Airtel from India owns 28.18% of the shares, while the remaining 10% is held by general shareholders in Bangladesh. The company was jointly launched in 1997 by Telecom Malaysia and AK Khan and Company of Bangladesh under the brand name Aktel. In 2008, AK Khan and Company sold their shares. The company underwent a rebranding in 2010, changing its name from Aktel to Robi.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-27 12:21:07,2024-02-27 17:02:40

<p>""Foreign trade is more challenging, competitive and knowledge-based than ever before,"" he said while delivering his speech as the chief guest at a function at Bangabandhu International Conference Center (BICC) on the occasion of 'National Textile Day-2024'.</p>
<p>President Shahabuddin called for increasing the number of products in the country&rsquo;s export basket instead of relying on only a few products finding out new export destination as well.</p>
<p>""Instead of relying on a few countries, we need to spread the market for our export products in all possible parts of the world"" he said.</p>
<p>Alongside, he emphasized using diplomatic missions in this regard and asked to prioritise economic diplomacy.</p>
<p>Calling the workers as the driving force of manufacturing industries, he said</p>
<p>""Remember that you are not just running a business for profit. You have to take social responsibility seriously and guarantee fair rights and wages.""</p>
<p>Saying that factories and workers complement each other, he said if the workers live happily, it will be good for the industry.</p>
<p>He also urged all concerned to be vigilant so that no vested quarter can spoil the environment of the production-oriented factories.</p>
<p>Besides, he said the government is working and will always be with the industry to continue to increase productivity.</p>
<p>The president called upon all to welcome new technologies to meet the challenges of the 4th industrial revolution according to the demands of the international market.</p>
<p>For the expansion of the international market, businessmen, industrialists and investors should come forward with the aim of expanding technical education with modern technology and creating skilled human resources, he said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-27 14:09:33,

<p>The power tariff might increase between Tk 0.34 and Tk 0.70 per unit, he said while talking to reporters at his office in the Power and Energy Ministry.</p>
<p>This step is being taken as part of the government move to come out of the subsidy now being given to the power sector, said the minister.</p>

<p>The government last increased the electricity tariff in March last year.</p>
<p>According to the BPDB’s Annual Report 2022-23, the fiscal year saw the production of 87,024 million kilowatt hours of electricity at a total cost of TK 98,646 crore.   </p>
<p>Its per unit production cost was Tk 11.33, while it was selling electricity at Tk 6.7 per unit — incurring a loss of about Tk 4.63 per unit.</p>
<p>This imbalance has led to a staggering loss of Tk 47,788 crore for the fiscal year, as the government grapples with purchasing power from private and international sources at significantly higher rates.</p>
<p>With this huge loss, the government has been facing great trouble as it has to purchase electricity worth Tk 82,778 crore from private sector power producers, while it generates electricity worth Tk 13,307 crore from its own generation plants.</p>

FAO supports Bangladesh in strengthening pesticide regulations,Kazi Farzana Haque,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Foreign Affairs/131642,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6513594.webp,Bangladesh,Foreign Affairs,FAO supports Bangladesh in strengthening pesticide regulations,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5022:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has officially handed over its recommendations on the pesticide rules to the Department of Agricultural Extension under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Representatives from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change participated in a workshop held on Tuesday on collaboration in relevant component of the projects.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saso Martinov, Senior Technical Advisor, FAO Bangladesh and Dr Fahmida Khanom, Additional Secretary (Development) of&nbsp; the ministry participated&nbsp; in the event.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&nbsp; was chaired by Ashraf Uddin, Director, Plant Protection Wing, Department of Agricultural Extension.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The government of Bangladesh, in collaboration with FAO, is taking crucial steps to update the Pesticide Rules under the Pesticide Act of 2018, prioritizing public health and environmental protection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This collaborative effort aims to incorporate international best legal practices into the pesticide regulations and ensure the safe and responsible use of these chemicals in the country. The initiative is done under the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) project that is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saso Martinov, Senior Technical Advisor, FAO stated that, &ldquo;This is an important step in managing pesticides that are used in agriculture in Bangladesh. FAO team has handed over its recommendation on the pesticide rules today and will continue to support the Government of Bangladesh in its efforts to reduce the risks of pesticides following FAO&rsquo;s 4 Betters including a better life and a better environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dr Fahmida Khanom, Additional Secretary (Development), MoEFCC highlighted FAO&rsquo;s support in Bangladesh's achievement of becoming free from DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and said &ldquo;The government now wants to focus heavily on proper handling and recycling of toxic pesticide containers and the recommendations will work as a buffer for future activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One key focus area of the Pesticide Rules is the transparent and comprehensive pesticide registration process, overseen by the Director of the Plant Protection Wing of the Department of Agricultural Extension under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A great majority of citizens of Bangladesh rely on agriculture for food security.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Improper pesticide use can lead to residues exceeding safe limits on food crops, posing health risks to consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, unregulated pesticide use can harm beneficial insects, pollute water sources, and contaminate soil, jeopardizing biodiversity and ecosystem health. Stringent registration enables evaluation of potential environmental impacts as well as risks to human health before allowing pesticides into the market for consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">FAO Recommendations aim to implement more strict measures to prevent the infiltration of highly hazardous pesticides into the market.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This includes rigorous assessments of potential risks to human health and the environment before granting registration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The initiative prioritizes safe and responsible pesticide waste disposal. FAO Recommendations would incorporate robust regulations to ensure proper collection, transportation, and treatment of pesticide waste, minimizing the risk of environmental contamination.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recognizing the environmental impact of pesticide packaging, the project also provides guidance on its management in line with the Environment Conservation Act of 1995 and the Solid Waste Management Rules of 2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This will promote environmentally responsible packaging practices and contribute to a cleaner and healthier Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Implementing the updated Pesticide Rules requires concrete action.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A nationwide collection program for pesticide containers supported by FAO, coupled with awareness campaigns and incentives, will ensure responsible disposal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Training inspectors and empowering local authorities will strengthen enforcement, also engaging farmers through education programmes promoting safe handling and application, protecting themselves and the environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These crucial steps would pave the way for a healthier Bangladesh where responsible pesticide use safeguards public health and the environment.</p>

<p>The global event will take place on March 1-3, 2024, under the auspices of Tayyip Erdogan, President of the Republic of T&uuml;rkiye, and on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of T&uuml;rkiye.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister will be visiting T&uuml;rkiye at the invitation of his Turkish counterpart and is expected to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the Forum, a senior official told UNB.</p>
<p>Turkish Ambassador to Bangladesh Ramis Şen recently met Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud and highlighted the Antalya Diplomacy Forum.</p>
<p>The Ambassador hoped that Foreign Minister Hasan will actively join the Forum.</p>
<p>In its third edition, the Antalya Diplomacy Forum will gather heads of states and governments, ministers, diplomats, business leaders, academics, think-tankers, and youth and media representatives for an all-encompassing debate.</p>
<p>The overarching theme of this year&rsquo;s Forum will be &ldquo;Advancing Diplomacy in Times of Turmoil&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It aims to serve as a thorough reflection and the means for searching a peaceful way out of the turbulent period our world is going through.</p>
<p>Ongoing wars, acts of terrorism, irregular migration, rise of xenophobia and Islamophobia, unforeseen risks of AI, climate change, natural disasters, pandemics and widening socioeconomic gaps form a non-exhaustive list of global challenges.</p>
<p>The erosion and subsequently the loss of trust in the rules-based international order is also a worrying trend, undermining the predictability of the environment in which states operate.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the world is going through a period of several turmoils and these challenges may also act as agents leading to structural changes in the global political, economic and security landscape.</p>
<p>Moreover, as one third of the world&rsquo;s population is heading to the polls in 2024, many questions about the impact of elections on pressing international issues as well as concerns on AI manipulated disinformation and fake news will be on the international agenda.</p>
<p>How do we make better use of diplomacy to tackle global challenges in the current state of affairs?</p>
<p>The answer certainly lies in the adoption of a novel understanding of diplomacy, beyond its essential and traditional framework of dialogue.</p>
<p>For that purpose, the host country said, the Antalya Diplomacy Forum will once again provide its distinguished participants an interactive and thought-provoking platform to address the challenging issues shaping the global and regional agendas, and to discuss innovative tools to advance diplomacy in times of turmoil.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-28 22:04:06,

"Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors, genuine willingness keys to take Dhaka-Washington ties to next stage",Farid Hossain,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6506592.webp,Special,,"Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors, genuine willingness keys to take Dhaka-Washington ties to next stage","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:2:{i:0;s:5693:""<p>Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors and a genuine willingness to broaden ties in new areas will drive forward the Bangladesh-US relations to the next level leaving behind pre-election political differences between the two countries, experts opine viewing post-polls relations.</p>
<p>“Both countries have long and old ties in every aspect of statecraft and bilateral relations. The new chapter denotes that these two countries would deepen their engagement beyond the much-debated political differences,” Prof Shahab Enam Khan of Jahangirnagar University’s Department of International Relations told UNB this week.</p>
<p>A senior US government delegation visited Bangladesh last week with an agenda that included strengthening diplomatic ties and advancing shared interests in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The delegation comprised Eileen Laubacher, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for South Asia, US National Security Council (NSC); Michael Schiffer, USAID Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Asia; and Afreen Akhter, US Department of State Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Their discussions also focused on climate change, trade, the Rohingya refugee crisis, and labor rights. The delegation met with senior officials, business executives, civil society organisations, and top opposition leaders.</p>
<p>Prof Shahab, who is also executive director and CEO at Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs, assumes the issues of Bangladesh’s national security and the Indo-Pacific agenda coincide with the US ones.</p>
<p>Hence, he thinks, the bilateral relations will get new momentum in defense, security, non-traditional security, and human security issues.</p>
<p>“Myanmar, too, is a wake-up call here. This further gives me a sense that the US would not see Bangladesh through any third-country prism,” said the international affairs expert.</p>
<p>Instead, he thinks, both countries may synchronise their mutual interests in the coming days. “Bangladesh, after all, has been the most dependable country for the superpowers as it comes with no fractured ties with the regional neighbours or any hyped-up political or security narratives.”</p>
<p>Prof Shahab said these two factors make Bangladesh a regional security guarantor needed to keep the Indo-Pacific region stable.</p>
<p><strong>A New Chapter and Priorities</strong></p>
<p>Asked about the priority areas in opening a new chapter in their relations with Bangladesh, US Embassy spokesperson Haynes Mahoney said Bangladesh is an Indo-Pacific partner and the United States is Bangladesh’s largest source of foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>“We are committed to working together to ensure the Indo-Pacific region remains free, open, peaceful, and secure. We also engage with Bangladesh on broader sets of priorities,” he told UNB.</p>
<p>“As President Biden has stated, we will look at ways to build on our long-standing partnership to improve economic growth, mitigate climate change, and to invest in people so they have opportunities to lead healthier and more prosperous lives,” Haynes added.</p>
<p>The US is pleased to see Bangladesh’s Indo-Pacific outlook, which he thinks “really mirrors” what they are trying to do in terms of economic investment, working with Bangladesh on climate change, and building out security and defense cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is, of course, one of the largest UN Peacekeeping contributors, and we are very pleased to support that effort, Haynes said.</p>
<p>Highlighting economic opportunities, he said leveraging their investments in development through the private sector and engaging youth are areas that they are increasingly focused on.</p>
<p>“We are bringing business leaders and youth together to identify ways to equip young people with more marketable job-skills – creating a more talented workforce with the skills needed to drive companies towards greater success and help Bangladesh be more competitive in the global marketplace,” he said.</p>
<p>The US Embassy spokesperson said they continue to identify ways to strengthen the economic and trade ties between the two countries, while building on our work together to accelerate socio-economic development so that people in all corners of the country have equitable opportunities to live healthier and more prosperous lives.</p>
<p>“We are looking for ways in which we can collaborate with Bangladesh to modernize its military and be able to invest in maritime domain awareness to be able to understand what is on your coastal borders, what is coming in by air, land, and sea,"" he said.</p>
<p><strong>Issues around GSOMIA and ACSA</strong></p>
<p>Asked about the progress regarding the two proposed agreements - General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) and the Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), Haynes said GSOMIA is being considered between the US and Bangladesh armed forces as the two sides continue to explore opportunities for “more substantive and deeper” engagement.</p>
<p>The agreement is effectively a commitment that each side will effectively secure any information or sensitive materials received from the other, he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he said, ACSA facilitate the exchange of logistical support between partner militaries and enhance the opportunities for meaningful engagement.</p>
<p>Although there are no discussions at present between the US and Bangladesh about pursuing an ACSA, this could change in the future should the two sides determine it offers sufficient benefit, Haynes said.</p>
<p> </p>"";i:1;s:4595:""<p><strong>Myanmar Situation and Its Impacts</strong></p>
<p>“Obviously, we are very concerned, and we are following the developments in Burma [Myanmar] closely. The ongoing clashes in Burma [Myanmar] are deeply troubling. This is a significant concern not only for the region but also for the international community,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>He said the ongoing crisis in Myanmar is a pressing issue, and the United States has contributed more than two billion dollars in humanitarian assistance to this crisis, including approximately $500 million in Myanmar.</p>
<p>“It is essential to address the root causes of the crisis, promote stability, and work towards finding a sustainable and humane resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>They emphasised the need for diplomatic efforts and international cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the situation in Myanmar, aiming for a “comprehensive and inclusive” approach to ensure the well-being of the affected populations and regional stability.</p>
<p>“We also recognize the need to continue support for civilians displaced by the conflict in Burma, including both internally displaced people in Burma and Rohingya refugees residing in Bangladesh,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the United States provided an additional $87 million to continue providing food and nutrition assistance to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, which helped raise the monthly food rations for refugees to $10 per person per month.</p>
<p>“That was an important step to make sure they are getting enough food and nutrition to stay healthy. We also continue to provide support to Bangladeshi host communities through a range of multisectoral interventions, including job-skills and business literacy training to help people improve their livelihoods,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p><strong>A Positive Shift</strong></p>
<p>South Asia Institute Director at the Wilson Center and writer of Foreign Policy's weekly South Asia Brief Michael Kugelman has said US-Bangladesh relations have taken a more positive turn after a Bangladesh election that the US described as not free or fair.</p>
<p>He explained why, and also argued that this shift is not actually as sharp as it seems and noted that the visit came amid an apparent shift in bilateral relations, especially in terms of tone and messaging.</p>
<p>In the months ahead of Bangladesh’s Jan. 7 elections, the United States took strong steps to promote human rights and democracy, including through sanctions, visa restrictions, and public criticism.</p>
<p>Though that US State Department characterised the vote as not free or fair, US President Joe Biden sent a letter to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that welcomed the “next chapter” in the US-Bangladesh relationship; it did not mention rights or democracy.</p>
<p>During the U.S. delegation’s visit this week, Bangladeshi officials, including Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud, underscored the fresh start theme.</p>
<p>Salman F Rahman, an advisor to PM Hasina, said the “election is now a thing of the past.” Messaging from both sides was warm and effusive, with plenty of references to the partnership’s strength.</p>
<p>What accounts for the turnaround? Michael Kugelman said one possibility is Washington’s desire to distance itself from the highly charged political environment in Dhaka.</p>
<p>“The more U.S. officials publicly opine about human rights and democracy in Bangladesh, the more they risk getting dragged into it,” he wrote in Foreign Policy’s South Asia Brief.</p>
<p>He said strategic considerations are also likely at play and the previous US approach effectively gave Beijing and Moscow an advantage in Dhaka and rankled New Delhi.</p>
<p>“Geopolitical factors also play a role in the new US approach. The conflict in neighboring Myanmar is intensifying, and Bangladesh hosts hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees but seeks to repatriate them,” Kugelman said.</p>
<p>Washington wants to ensure that it has sufficient diplomatic space to engage with Dhaka on these sensitive issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kugelman said with US foreign-policy attention increasingly focused on instability in the Middle East, the United States wants to reduce diplomatic headaches elsewhere.</p>
<p>“The relationship’s tone and messaging are emphasizing positivity and potential, not public pressure. Ultimately, this reflects that, for now, the United States has concluded that smooth relations with Bangladesh are a strategic imperative,” he said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:2:{i:0;s:25:""news/details/4432665.webp"";i:1;s:25:""news/details/6120685.webp"";}s:8:""captions"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}}",2024-03-01 15:54:40,2024-03-01 16:01:35

<p>The event was held on the university&rsquo;s new green campus located in Merul Badda which features environmental sustainability on Thursday.</p>
<p>Highlighting the university's commitment to academic excellence, cultural enrichment, and environmental conservation, various aspects of BRAC University's dedication to environmental sustainability were showcased during the event. The university also shared its aspiration to lead in providing a comprehensive educational experience by engaging in environmentally friendly initiatives, showcasing local performances, and fostering discussions on pertinent issues.</p>
<p>In this &ldquo;Meet and Greet with Media&rdquo; event, Tamara Hasan Abed, Chairperson, Board of Trustees, BRAC University, along with other members of the Board of Trustees, Professor Syed Mahfuzul Aziz, Acting Vice-Chancellor, deans of schools, department chairpersons, and journalists from various media outlets were present.</p>
<p>Covering 7 acres of land in Merul Badda, this expansive BRAC University campus is the first environmentally friendly and sustainable advanced city campus in Bangladesh. Inspired by the ecosystem of the Sundarbans, the campus has been constructed to offer a blend of nature and architecture. The design, construction, and environmental aspects of this building involve experts from various countries, including Singapore, China, and Germany, contributing to its various unique features.</p>
<p>The building utilizes modern technologies such as cross-ventilation and hybrid thermal management systems, allowing light and air to enter from all sides. The use of Aerodynamic Fins ensures the optimal flow of air within the building.</p>
<p>The greenery, resembling a green carpet on the building's facade, provides oxygen, and the hybrid cooling system brings fresh air into the classrooms. As a result, even if students sit for long hours in class, fatigue will be minimized. These features contribute to reduced dependency on air conditioning, leading to the building's 40% energy self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Numerous rain chains have been installed to allow rainwater to reach trees and vegetation within the building and use the excess to replenish water bodies on the ground floor. The building also houses an advanced sewage treatment plant for waste management.</p>
<p>On the roof, there are solar panels generating 1.5 megawatts of electricity, providing 25% of the energy required for the building. The majority of the space in this modern and aesthetic building has been kept open for the students. In these open spaces, they can engage in mutual interactions and participate in various extracurricular activities. The campus is designed with universal accessibility so that students with special needs can easily access the campus and move around all areas comfortably.</p>
<p>Tamara Hasan Abed, Chairperson, Board of Trustees, BRAC University, shared the inspiring story behind the construction of the university's new eco-friendly campus and the educational philosophy of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. She said, ""Sir Fazle's vision was to establish a university where learning and pedagogy would flourish while coexisting with nature. The new campus is designed to combine nature and modern architecture to inspire future generations to think differently about life. While urbanization is an inevitable consequence of development, we must discover innovative solutions to safeguard nature. This new campus will serve as a benchmark for students and professionals in urban planning and environmental conservation.""</p>
<p>BRAC University's new campus is envisioned to serve as a laboratory for knowledge and science, as expressed by Professor Syed Mahfuzul Aziz, Acting Vice-Chancellor, BRAC University. He states, ""Essentially, we want to establish this new campus of BRAC University as a hub for knowledge and science. Our aspiration is to make this university a flagship institution in Bangladesh through ethical research and the provision of high-quality education. We are working towards that goal.""</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the event, the closing remarks were delivered by Salahdin Imam, a member of BRAC University's Board of Trustees and the Chair of the Campus Development Committee. The event was hosted by Khairul Basher, the Director of the Office of Communications, BRAC University.</p>
<p>Following the program, invited journalists were given a tour of BRAC University's new campus by Ariful Islam, Chief Financial Officer of BRAC University, Sajedul Karim Chowdhury, Director of Operations of BRAC University, and Shafiqul Islam, Architect of the BRAC University campus project.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-01 18:17:18,

<p>The minister was addressing a session entitled 'Ensuring Public and Private Financial Flows Aligned with Environmental Goals to Close the Massive Funding' at the 6th United Nations Environment Conference being held in Kenya&rsquo;s Nairobi on Friday.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said the leadership of the government of the world made pledges in the past in which promises were unkept.

<p>Earlier, paying tribute to the memory of the Father of the Nation, the Land Minister said, after victory in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took various steps to combat pollution and conserve biodiversity in newly independent Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The minister said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina realized that it would not be possible to achieve a Smart, Sonar Bangla &mdash; to materialize the dream of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman &mdash; without taking sustainable measures. She has taken robust policies and plans to protect Bangladesh from the adverse effects of climate change and global warming and create a pollution-free environment in the country. In 2011, she took the initiative to bring the conservation and development of environment and biodiversity as a constitutional obligation and adopted the long-term delta plan.</p>

<p>Bangladesh urged the global community to urgently change the definition of climate migrants and refugees to bring it in line with the UN definition of migrants and refugees.</p>
<p>He mentioned that life thrives only on this planet as far as we know.</p>
<p>At the first panel discussion of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum held in Antalya, T&uuml;rkiye on Saturday, the Foreign Minister spoke on global climate change, climate migrant and climate refugee issues.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers of Malaysia and Bangladesh, State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, and Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Vietnam discussed various aspects of the &ldquo;Building Asia-Pacific Regional Architecture: The Challenge of Unmatching Interests&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hasan mentioned that like many small and island nations, Bangladesh has become one of the worst sufferers of climate change and global warming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire coastal area of Bangladesh is at the risk of inundation due to the sea level rise and over the last three decades, rise of greenhouse gases, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""And this phenomenon is constantly causing climate migration. The issue is now so real that Bangladesh urgently needs the world community to change the definition of climate migrants and refugees,"" he said.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister mentioned that while the country and many environmental scientists have been focusing on the issue for many years, many world leaders have not believed in it until lately it has become evident to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Yet the rich countries, the major contributors to global warming, are doing very little to address the issue and protect our environment,"" Hasan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are local issues that make the impact global.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bangladesh, as one of the worst sufferers of this harsh reality, urged all activists and leaders to accept the importance of changing the definition of climate migrants and refugees and devise an acceptable definition of it to protect the victims and the future generations, said the Foreign Minister.&nbsp;</p>

What Lies Ahead for Tamim Iqbal?,Shayan S Khan,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Cricket/131850,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/9154556.webp,Sports,Cricket,What Lies Ahead for Tamim Iqbal?,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3670:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Just over a month ago, despite being one of the finest batters that Bangladesh has ever produced, Tamim Iqbal’s cricketing future seemed uncertain.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He found himself out of the national team, voluntarily withdrawing from the national contract, and appeared less assured both on and off the field, making his fans ponder about the future of their beloved batting star. The uncertainty suffered the double blow by prolonged injury concerns. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fast-forward a mere month and a half: Tamim now exudes more confidence than ever. Emerging as the highest run-scorer in the recently concluded Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), a feat considered exceptional for any cricketer in Bangladesh, he led Fortune Barishal to their maiden BPL title. His recent triumphs naturally beg the question—what's next for Tamim?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In BPL 2024, Tamim demonstrated he still has plenty of cricket left in him. However, how his cricket may serve the country or the interests of the national team remains unanswered, as Tamim faced the media after the BPL final in Mirpur.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Uncertainty shrouded Tamim’s future mid last year when he abruptly retired from all forms of cricket after his fitness comments faced heavy criticism from board president Nazmul Hasan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Though he rescinded his decision following intervention from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Tamim never fully returned to the national team's fold. Stepping down from captaincy just before the last Asia Cup, he then missed the World Cup as the selectors kept him out due to concerns about his playing fitness—a move Tamim publicly criticized.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These events seemingly marked the end of Tamim’s career as a national cricketer. Yet, his standout performances in BPL 2024—both as a batter and captain—prompted Bangladesh’s cricketing fraternity to reassess Tamim’s future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Asked before the BPL if he's interested in a national team comeback, Tamim deferred clarification until after the tournament. As the BPL concluded, Tamim remains eager to sit down with BCB bosses to determine his future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I’m traveling abroad tomorrow morning,” Tamim stated after the BPL final. “I didn't get to speak with him (new chief selector Gazi Ashraf Hossain), but I planned to discuss with Jalal bhai, the cricket operation chairman. Hopefully, we can talk upon my return.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tamim stressed the need for the right environment. “I want to clarify that many things need to align if I return. It's not just about playing. I probably have only two years of cricket left, so discussions are essential.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yet, Tamim did not elaborate on his expectations from BCB.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under Tamim’s leadership, Fortune Barishal exuded camaraderie during BPL 2024. Senior cricketers Mahmudullah Riyad and Mushfiqur Rahim were pivotal to Barishal’s success. While Tamim had tasted BPL glory before, it was Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur's first win.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">By dedicating the BPL title to Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur, Tamim showcased his generosity. However, while his fans cheer this gesture, they eagerly await more reasons to celebrate—specifically, Tamim's decision regarding a potential return to the national team.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While taking part on a point of order in parliament Chunnu expressed his anger over the deadly fire incident in the city’s Bailey Road saying that the government needs to be held accountable. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Former Livestock and Fisheries Minister Rezaul Karim demanded to amend respective laws to try the perpetrators involved in such incidents under speedy tribunals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Chunnu said that the people of the country pay taxes to run the government. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“It is the responsibility of the government to provide security to the citizens,” he said. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He also said that construction of buildings requires permission from six agencies of the government.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“But there is no monitoring of the buildings after giving the permission,” he alleged.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The opposition chief whip said that a building was built for one purpose, but used for another purpose. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Who will take responsibility for the people who died at the Bailey road inferno? It is the responsibility of the government and the government offices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mujibul Haque said that after such an incident, the government says that an investigation will be conducted, and an investigation team is formed. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“But then there is no follow up. The country cannot continue like this. The government needs to be held accountable. The government needs to take responsibility.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Meanwhile, participating in the discussion on the thanksgiving motion on the President’s speech, SM Rezaul Karim told parliament that there are 15 restaurants in one building in the Satmasjid area of Dhanmondi although they have no permission.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“There are hundreds of restaurants in buildings on the road side of Road No. 27 in Dhanmondi but they have no permission. The situation is the same in different multi-storied buildings at Taltala in Khilgaon,” he said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rezaul also apprehends that more such incidents will happen in future, if the government is not aware of this. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I will ask the government to take responsibility and who is responsible for these, be it Rajuk, fire brigade, environment, take strict measures against them and make arrangements so that such incidents do not happen in the future.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He called upon the government to take stern actions against the persons involved in such deadly incidents so that any such incidents do not take place in future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2019, 27 people died in the fire at Banani's FR Tower. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pointing to the fire at Banani’s FR Tower when he was the Housing and Public Works Minister, he said, “We had investigated and filed a report against 62 people. Unfortunately, even after a high-level committee gave its report, cases were not filed against everyone. Names of many people have been dropped while giving the charge sheet.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rezaul Karim demanded to amend respective laws to try the perpetrators under speedy tribunals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Earlier, at the beginning of the session, the House expressed deep shock over the loss of lives in the fire at Bailey Road.</p>

US military aircraft airdrop thousands of meals into Gaza in emergency humanitarian aid operation,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Middle East/131869,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/8777976.webp,World,Middle East,US military aircraft airdrop thousands of meals into Gaza in emergency humanitarian aid operation,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3782:""<p>U.S. military C-130 cargo planes dropped food in pallets over Gaza on Saturday in the opening stage of an emergency humanitarian assistance authorized by President Joe Biden after more than 100 Palestinians who had surged to pull goods off an aid convoy were killed during a chaotic encounter with Israeli troops.</p>
<p>Three planes from Air Forces Central dropped 66 bundles containing about 38,000 meals into Gaza at 8:30 a.m. EST (3:30 p.m. local). The bundles were dropped in southwest Gaza, on the beach along the territory's Mediterranean coast, one U.S. official said. The airdrop was coordinated with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, which said it had two food airdrops Saturday in northern Gaza and has conducted several rounds in recent months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The combined operation included U.S. Air Force and RJAF C-130 aircraft and respective Army Soldiers specialized in aerial delivery of supplies, built bundles and ensured the safe drop of food aid,&rdquo; U.S. Central Command said in a post on ""X"", formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>The airdrop is expected to be the first of many, U.S. Central Command said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Friday announced the U.S. would begin air dropping food to starving Gazans after at least 115 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more wounded in the Thursday attack as they scrambled for aid, the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people had rushed about 30 trucks bringing a predawn delivery of aid to the north. Palestinians said nearby Israeli troops shot into the crowds. Israel said they fired warning shots toward the crowd and insisted many of the dead were trampled.</p>
<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Friday that the airdrops were being planned to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance in a safe way to people on the ground. The United States believes the airdrops will help address the dire situation in Gaza, but they are no replacement for trucks, which can transport far more aid more effectively, though Thursday&rsquo;s events also showed the risks with ground transport.</p>
<p>Kirby said the airdrops have an advantage over trucks because planes can move aid to a particular location very quickly. But in terms of volume, the airdrops will be &ldquo;a supplement to, not a replacement for moving things in by ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The C-130 is widely used to deliver aid to remote places because of its ability to land in austere environments.</p>
<p>A C-130 can airlift as much as 42,000 pounds of cargo and its crews know how to rig the cargo, which sometimes can include even vehicles, onto massive pallets that can be safely dropped out of the back of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Air Force loadmasters secure the bundles onto pallets with netting that is rigged for release in the back of a C-130, and then crews release it with a parachute when the aircraft reaches the intended delivery zone.</p>
<p>The Air Force's C-130 has been used in years past to air drop humanitarian into Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and other locations and the airframe is used in an annual multi-national &ldquo;Operation Christmas Drop&rdquo; that air drops pallets of toys, supplies, nonperishable food and fishing supplies to remote locations in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau.</p>
<p>Since the war began on Oct. 7, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies, except for a trickle of aid entering the south from Egypt at the Rafah crossing and Israel&rsquo;s Kerem Shalom crossing.</p>

<p>Three planes from Air Forces Central dropped 66 bundles containing about 38,000 meals into Gaza at 8:30 a.m. EST (3:30 p.m. local). The bundles were dropped in southwest Gaza, on the beach along the territory's Mediterranean coast. The airdrop was coordinated with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, which said it had two food airdrops Saturday in northern Gaza and has conducted several rounds in recent months.</p>

<p>""The amount of aid flowing to Gaza is not nearly enough and we will continue to pull out every stop we can to get more aid in,"" President Joe Biden said Saturday in a post on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said on X that &ldquo;the combined operation included U.S. Air Force and RJAF C-130 aircraft and respective Army Soldiers specialized in aerial delivery of supplies, built bundles and ensured the safe drop of food aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U.S. airdrop is expected to be the first of many.</p>
<p>Three Biden administration officials said the planes dropped the military Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) &mdash; shelf-stable meals that contain a day's worth of calories in each sealed package &mdash; in locations that were thought would provide civilians with the greatest level of safety to access aid. Afterward, the U.S. monitored the sites and was able to see civilians approach and distribute food among themselves, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that had not been made public.</p>
<p>Biden on Friday announced the U.S. would begin air dropping food to starving Gazans after at least 115 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more wounded in the Thursday attack as they scrambled for aid, the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people had rushed about 30 trucks bringing a predawn delivery of aid to the north. Palestinians said nearby Israeli troops shot into the crowds. Israel said they fired warning shots toward the crowd and insisted many of the dead were trampled.</p>

<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Friday that the airdrops were being planned to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance in a safe way to people on the ground. The United States believes the airdrops will help address the dire situation in Gaza, but they are no replacement for trucks, which can transport far more aid more effectively, though Thursday&rsquo;s events also showed the risks with ground transport.</p>
<p>Kirby said the airdrops have an advantage over trucks because planes can move aid to a particular location very quickly. But in terms of volume, the airdrops will be &ldquo;a supplement to, not a replacement for moving things in by ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The C-130 is widely used to deliver aid to remote places because of its ability to land in austere environments.</p>
<p>A C-130 can airlift as much as 42,000 pounds of cargo and its crews know how to rig the cargo, which sometimes can include even vehicles, onto massive pallets that can be safely dropped out of the back of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Air Force loadmasters secure the bundles onto pallets with netting that is rigged for release in the back of a C-130, and then crews release it with a parachute when the aircraft reaches the intended delivery zone.</p>
<p>The Air Force's C-130 has been used in years past to air drop humanitarian into Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and other locations and the airframe is used in an annual multi-national &ldquo;Operation Christmas Drop&rdquo; that air drops pallets of toys, supplies, nonperishable food and fishing supplies to remote locations in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau.</p>
<p>Since the war began on Oct. 7, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies, except for a trickle of aid entering the south from Egypt at the Rafah crossing and Israel&rsquo;s Kerem Shalom crossing.</p>

Fishermen return to crab collection in Sundarbans after a 2-month ban,Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/2110111.webp,Environment,,Fishermen return to crab collection in Sundarbans after a 2-month ban,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:2890:""<p>Fishermen have resumed collecting crabs in the Sundarbans following the conclusion of a two-month government-enforced ban designed to safeguard the breeding season of crabs.</p>
<p>The ban, aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the crab population, ended last Thursday at midnight, with fishermen from coastal regions such as Mongla, Rampal, and Dakope seen entering the forest on Sunday with necessary equipment for crab collection.</p>
<p>The hiatus, necessitated by the breeding season of crabs in January and February, saw the issuance of pass-permits by the forest department halted. With the ban lifted, permits are once again being distributed, allowing the fishermen to legally collect crabs from the Sundarbans' extensive network of rivers and canals.</p>

<p>Spanning 6,017 sqkm in Bangladesh, including 1,874.1 sqkm of aquatic areas, the Sundarbans are home to 450 rivers and canals, along with 14 species of crabs.</p>
<p>To protect these species, certain canals have been designated as sanctuaries, with restrictions on crab collection in canals narrower than 25 feet enforced year-round.</p>
<p>Approximately 15,000 fishermen, equipped with valid forest department passes, depend on crab collecting within the non-restricted areas of the Sundarbans for their livelihood. The annual ban, instituted following the establishment of crab export guidelines, seeks to balance economic needs with environmental conservation.</p>

<p>Anisur Rahman, a crab collector from Joymoni in Mongla, highlighted the financial hardships faced by the fishermen due to the ban, pointing out the lack of governmental assistance during this period. Despite the ban's intent, there have been reports of illegal crab collection during the breeding season, undermining conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Mihir Kumar Doe, the forest Conservator of the Khulna region, confirmed that legal crab collection could resume in designated areas from March 2, with forest guards instructed to enhance patrolling to prevent illegal activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, strict guidelines have been put in place for the transportation of crabs, with divisional actions promised against violators.</p>
<p>This move to resume crab collection comes as a relief to many fishermen reliant on the trade, while the forest department remains vigilant against practices that could harm the Sundarbans' ecological balance.</p>
