Why Are We Asked to Put Our Phones on Airplane Mode During Flights?,"Rifat Tabassam, Karim Waheed",https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Tech News/131569,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/3487540.webp,Tech,Tech News,Why Are We Asked to Put Our Phones on Airplane Mode During Flights?,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:2:{i:0;s:2592:""<p>Ever wondered why you're asked to <strong>put your phone on airplane mode during flights</strong>? It's a common request once the plane doors close and the flight attendants start their safety instructions. While it might be tough to disconnect, especially on longer flights, airplane mode is necessary. But what exactly is it, and why do airlines insist on it? Let's dive into the science behind this familiar practice and <strong>why it's still essential for your phone use during air travel</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Airplane Mode?</strong></h2>
<p>Airplane mode is a setting available on smartphones that disables all wireless communication features. When activated, it turns off the phone's ability to connect to cellular networks, Wi-Fi signals, and Bluetooth devices. This means that calls, text messages, and notifications will not be received or sent while airplane mode is active. The purpose of airplane mode is to prevent potential interference with aircraft communication systems during flight, making it a requirement for many airlines during the journey.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Must Passengers Put Their Phones on Airplane Mode During Flights?</strong></h2>
<p>Airplane mode is crucial during flights to prevent any potential interference with sensitive airplane systems. These systems, including communication and navigation systems, rely on radio frequencies emitted from the ground. However, cell phones and tablets also use these frequencies for various functions like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and data transmission. The problem arises when crosstalk or adjacent-channel interference occurs, where one radio receiver picks up transmissions from nearby frequencies, disrupting the intended signals. This interference can be compared to tuning into a radio station and hearing another station's transmission on a nearby frequency.</p>

<p>Particularly during crucial moments like landing or emergencies, clear communication between the aircraft and ground control is vital. Airplane mode ensures that these communication lines remain open and interference-free. Additionally, with the advent of 5G technology, the risk of interference has increased, as signals from ground antennas and 5G devices might interfere with the airplane's radio altimeters, which gauge the distance from the ground during descent and landing. Therefore, using airplane mode helps ensure safe and uninterrupted communication during flights.</p>"";i:1;s:3036:""<h2><strong>What Happens If You Don&rsquo;t Put Your Phone on Airplane Mode?</strong></h2>
<p>If you forget to turn on airplane mode during a flight or choose to ignore the rules, the risk might seem low, but the potential consequences are serious. Pilots rely on the airplane's radio altimeters to determine the exact height above the ground, especially during challenging landings in poor visibility conditions like fog or snow. If a passenger's 5G-capable device isn't in airplane mode, it could send a signal that interferes with the airplane's radio altimeter, providing inaccurate height readings.</p>
<p>This misinformation could lead to dangerous situations during critical phases of flight, particularly during landing. Even if it's just one person disregarding the rules, it only takes one wrong signal and certain conditions for a disaster to occur. Therefore, it's essential to adhere to airplane mode regulations to ensure the safety of everyone onboard.</p>
<h2><strong>Is There Any Benefit of Putting the Phone on Airplane Mode?</strong></h2>
<p>Putting your phone on airplane mode during a flight offers several advantages. Firstly, it helps save a phone's battery life because it stops searching for cellular networks or Wi-Fi signals. This means your battery will last longer. Additionally, airplane mode speeds up charging because apps stop downloading updates, allowing your phone to charge faster. You'll also experience fewer interruptions without constant notifications and messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Tech/how-ai-can-improve-education/119364"">How AI Can Improve Education</a></p>
<p>Moreover, airplane mode reduces your exposure to electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation, which can interfere with sensitive aircraft equipment. Lastly, it helps minimize roaming charges, particularly when traveling internationally, by disconnecting from mobile networks and avoiding unexpected fees. To put it simply, using airplane mode on a flight enhances convenience, safety, and comfort.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Airplane mode is not just a precaution but a crucial safety measure during flights. It can disable all wireless communication features to prevent interference with sensitive aircraft systems, ensuring clear communication between the aircraft and ground control. Failure to activate airplane mode poses serious risks, potentially disrupting vital equipment like radio altimeters and compromising the safety of the flight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, aside from safety, there are several benefits to using airplane mode, including preserving battery life, speeding up charging, reducing interruptions, and minimizing exposure to electromagnetic radiation. Ultimately, adhering to airplane mode regulations enhances the overall convenience, safety, and comfort of air travel.</p>

"Energy experts, economists oppose govt plan to raise electricity tariff",Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/4158672.webp,Special,,"Energy experts, economists oppose govt plan to raise electricity tariff","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5874:""<p>Energy experts and economists are voicing strong opposition against the government’s proposal to further increase electricity tariffs in Bangladesh. They are urging a re-evaluation of the power sector’s financial management, specifically pointing out excessive and questionable spending as a more viable solution to the sector’s financial woes.</p>
<p>They observed that currently there is 42 percent surplus electricity that can be attributed to government’s deals to set up costly power plants.</p>
<p>“Rampant, unjust expenses – from state-owned company board remunerations to large-scale power purchase deals – underscore the need for financial rectification over tariff hikes,” eminent energy expert Prof SM Shamsul Alam said.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/bangladesh-to-welcome-indonesian-investment-in-power-and-energy-sector-nasrul-hamid/130356"">Bangladesh to welcome Indonesian investment in power and energy sector: Nasrul Hamid</a></p>
<p>In a recent statement, State Minister for Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, Nasrul Hamid, hinted at an increase in electricity tariffs, starting from March, to counter the widening gap between production costs and sales revenues.</p>
<p>The move aims to alleviate financial pressures on the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and the national economy.</p>
<p>“We have to adjust power tariff at both the retail and bulk level to cover the production cost. However, gas prices may be adjusted only for the power plants,” Hamid declared, assuring that the impact on retail consumers would be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>Sources within the government revealed plans to implement a 5 percent hike in bulk electricity prices and a 3 percent increase at the retail level through an administrative order, bypassing traditional regulatory hearings.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/bangladesh-sweden-discuss-cooperation-in-green-energy-ict-with-more-investment/130041"">Bangladesh, Sweden discuss cooperation in green energy, ICT with more investment</a></p>
<p>According to Annual Report 2022-23 of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), per unit production cost was Tk 11.33, while electricity was sold at Tk 6.7 per unit — incurring a loss of about Tk 4.63 per unit.</p>
<p>This imbalance has led to a staggering loss of Tk 47,788 crore for the fiscal year, as the government grapples with purchasing electricity from private and international sources at significantly higher rates.</p>
<p>The government has been facing great trouble as it has to purchase electricity worth Tk 82,778 crore from private sector power producers, while it generates electricity worth Tk 13,307 crore from its own plants.</p>
<p>The annual report also shows that BPDB’s average per unit production cost from its own plants is Tk 7.63, while it is Tk 14.62 at the independent power producers or IPPs (private sector). At rental plants, the cost is Tk 12.53, at public plants Tk 6.85, and power imported from India cost Tk 8.77 per unit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sources in the BPDB said that in the last decade and a half, electricity prices have been increased on 11 occasions at the wholesale level and on 13 occasions at the consumer level.</p>
<p>In the current fiscal 2023-24, the gap between production cost and selling rate has further widened, and now average production cost of each unit is about Tk 12 while it’s selling at Tk 6.7 per unit.</p>
<p>Prof Shamsul Alam, also senior vice president of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB), said the unjust expenses in the state-owned power and energy entities have been established in the hearings of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC).</p>
<p>“But no steps were taken by the Power and Energy Ministry to address those issues. Rather, the regulatory body’s authority was taken away and it was turned non-functional by amending the relevant law,” the energy expert told UNB.</p>
<p>He said that in every case the government was found reluctant to take action to reduce the unjust expenses in the power and energy sector.</p>
<p>He also observed that the Rapid Increase of Power and Energy Supply (Special) Act has been key in creating the unbearable situation for which the government has to provide a huge capacity charge to the private power plant operators and subsidy to state entities.</p>
<p>“Now, the reality is that despite having 42 percent surplus electricity, the country has to endure significant load shedding, even during winter,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that it’s “ridiculous” that despite such surplus electricity and an obligation of capacity charge putting pressure on the economy, the government has announced a plan to import 9,000 MW of electricity from abroad.</p>
<p>Economist and Research Director at Centre for Policy Dialogue, Khondaker Golam Moazzem, in a recent seminar showed through a study report that all political parties in Bangladesh, except the ruling Awami League, want to get rid of capacity payments in the power sector.</p>
<p>He said that the reduction of over-generated power capacity was missing in the Awami League’s election manifesto announced before the January 7 national election.</p>
<p>He also recommended shutting down the costly rental power plants immediately to reduce the overall cost.</p>
<p>M. Tamim, special assistant to the chief advisor of the former caretaker government, said that without reducing the cost, the onus of the increased production cost is being imposed on the consumer.</p>
<p>“This way, the government subsidies can be reduced by increasing the electricity tariff. But it will neither address the dollar crisis, nor resolve the fuel import problem. So, load shedding cannot be prevented by increasing the power tariff,” he said.</p>

Former Pakistani Premier Nawaz Sharif's daughter and close aide takes over top provincial post,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Asia/131582,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/3267992.webp,World,Asia,Former Pakistani Premier Nawaz Sharif's daughter and close aide takes over top provincial post,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:2962:""<p>The eldest daughter and close aide of Pakistan&rsquo;s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday became the country&rsquo;s first-ever female chief minister in eastern Punjab province.</p>
<p>Mariam Nawaz, 50, was elected chief minister in a 220-0 vote in her favor, beating out rival for the post, Rana Aftab, who was nominated by the Sunni Ittehad Council, an ally of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan.</p>
<p>Opposition lawmakers supporting Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in parliament in 2022, boycotted the session of the 371-member Punjab Assembly.</p>
<p>Nawaz thanked God in televised remarks and promised she would equally serve those who voted for her and those who opposed her. &ldquo;The doors of my heart and office will remain open for the opposition as well,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/World/pakistans-former-premier-sharif-and-allies-agree-to-form-a-coalition/130892"">Pakistan's former premier Sharif and allies agree to form a coalition</a></p>
<p>Nawaz's appointment was largely expected following the Feb. 8 parliamentary elections in which her father's Pakistan Muslim League party, or PML-N, emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly or lower house of the parliament and in the Punjab Assembly.</p>
<p>The PML-N, which was initially trailing candidates representing Khan's supporters &mdash; the former cricket player turned Islamist politician was barred from running &mdash; emerged last Friday as the largest single winner in the election after receiving 24 additional seats &mdash; 20 from out of the 60 seats reserved for women, as well as four seats out of 10 reserved for minorities. Nine independent members have also joined the PML-N.</p>
<p>The PML-N is now heading into a coalition with the Pakistan People&rsquo;s Party, or PPP, with Nawaz's uncle, former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on a firm path to becoming the next prime minister, his second term in office.</p>
<p>The Sharifs are one of the top two families that have dominated Pakistani politics for decades. Nawaz Sharif, who served three times as a premier, was ousted from power in 2017 in a graft case. Khan, who replaced Sharif in 2018, granted him permission to travel to London for medical treatment following a court order.</p>

<p>Sharif came back to Pakistan from self-imposed exile abroad and returned to politics ahead of the elections. In her father's absence, Nawaz had led political campaigns and taken over his work.</p>
<p>However, many critics say Nawaz's rise is yet another case of nepotism. Earlier, one of Shehbaz Sharif's sons, Hamza Shehbaz, had also served as the chief minister in Punjab.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-26 16:18:59,2024-02-26 16:22:27
Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of blocking aid to Palestinians in violation of a UN court order,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Middle East/131583,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/5962826.webp,World,Middle East,Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of blocking aid to Palestinians in violation of a UN court order,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:7595:""<p>Israel has failed to comply with an order by the United Nations' top court to provide urgently needed aid to desperate people in the Gaza Strip, Human Rights Watch said Monday, a month after a landmark ruling in The Hague ordered Israel to moderate its war.</p>
<p>In a preliminary response to a South African petition accusing Israel of genocide, the U.N.&rsquo;s top court ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza. It stopped short of ordering an end to its military offensive that has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the tiny Palestinian enclave. Israel vehemently denies the charges against it, saying it is fighting a war in self-defense.</p>
<p>One month later and nearly five months into the war, preparations are underway for Israel to expand its ground operation into Rafah, Gaza&rsquo;s southernmost town along the border with Egypt, where 1.4 million Palestinians have flooded into in search of safety.</p>
<p>Early Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s office said the army had presented to the War Cabinet its operational plan for Rafah as well as plans to evacuate civilians from the battle zones. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>The situation in Rafah, where dense tent camps have sprouted to house the displaced, has sparked global concern and Israel&rsquo;s allies have warned that it must protect civilians in its battle against Hamas.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/World/zelenskyy-31000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-since-russia-launched-full-scale-invasion/131564"">Zelenskyy: 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed since Russia launched full-scale invasion</a></p>
<p>Also Monday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said he was submitting his government's resignation. The move, which still must be accepted by President Mahmoud Abbas, could open the door to U.S.-backed reforms in the Palestinian Authority, which the U.S. wants to rule postwar Gaza but in a revitalized shape.</p>
<p>In its ruling last month, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to follow six provisional measures, including taking &ldquo;immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the orders, Israel also must submit a report on what it is doing to adhere to the measures within a month. While Monday marked a month since the court&rsquo;s orders were issued, it was not immediately clear whether Israel had handed in such a report. The Israeli Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said Israel was not adhering to the court&rsquo;s order on aid provision, citing a 30% drop in the daily average number of aid trucks entering Gaza in the weeks following the court&rsquo;s ruling. It said Israel was not adequately facilitating fuel deliveries to hard-hit northern Gaza and blamed Israel for blocking aid from reaching the north, where the World Food Program said last week it was forced to suspend aid deliveries because of increasing chaos in the isolated part of the territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Israeli government has simply ignored the court&rsquo;s ruling, and in some ways even intensified its repression, including further blocking lifesaving aid,&rdquo; said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/World/former-pakistani-premier-nawaz-sharifs-daughter-and-close-aide-takes-over-top-provincial-post/131582"">Former Pakistani Premier Nawaz Sharif's daughter and close aide takes over top provincial post</a></p>
<p>Echoing Human Rights Watch, the Association of International Development Agencies, a coalition of over 70 humanitarian organizations working in Gaza and the West Bank, said aid deliveries have slowed since the court's ruling, with almost no aid reaching areas in Gaza north of Rafah.</p>
<p>Israel denies it is restricting the entry of aid and has instead blamed humanitarian organizations operating inside Gaza, saying hundreds of trucks filled with aid sit idle on the Palestinian side of the main crossing. The U.N. says it can&rsquo;t always reach the trucks at the crossing because it is at times too dangerous.</p>
<p>Netanyahu&rsquo;s office also said Monday the War Cabinet had approved a plan to deliver humanitarian aid safely into Gaza in a way that would &ldquo;prevent the cases of looting.&rdquo; It did not disclose further details.</p>
<p>The war, launched after Hamas-led militants rampaged across southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 people hostage, has unleashed unimaginable devastation in Gaza.</p>
<p>Nearly 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza, two thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza which does not distinguish in its count between fighters and noncombatants. Israel says it has killed 10,000 militants, without providing evidence.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/World/palestinian-prime-minister-submits-governments-resignation-a-move-that-could-open-door-to-reforms/131578"">Palestinian prime minister submits government&rsquo;s resignation, a move that could open door to reforms</a></p>
<p>Fighting has flattened large swaths of Gaza's urban landscape, displacing about 80% of the territory&rsquo;s 2.3 million people who have crammed into increasingly smaller spaces looking for elusive safety.</p>
<p>The crisis has pushed a quarter of the population toward starvation and raised fears of imminent famine, especially in the northern part of Gaza, which was the first focus of Israel&rsquo;s ground invasion and where starving residents have been forced to eat animal fodder and search for food in demolished buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish death for the children because I cannot get them bread. I cannot feed them. I cannot feed my own children,"" Naim Abouseido yelled in anguish as he waited for aid in Gaza City. ""What did we do to deserve this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bushra Khalidi, with U.K. aid organization Oxfam, told The Associated Press that it had verified reports that children have died of starvation in the north in recent weeks, which she said indicated aid was not being scaled up despite the court ruling.</p>
<p>Israel said that 245 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Sunday, less than half the amount that entered daily before the war.</p>
<p>But Human Rights Watch, citing U.N. figures, said that between Jan. 27 and Feb. 21, the daily average of trucks entering stood at 93, compared to 147 trucks a day in the three weeks before the world court&rsquo;s ruling. The daily average dropped further, to 57, between Feb. 9 and 21, the figures showed.</p>
<p>Aid groups say deliveries continue to be hobbled by security issues. The French aid groups M&eacute;decins du Monde and Doctors Without Borders each said that facilities belonging to them were struck by Israeli forces in the weeks following the court order.</p>
<p>United Nations agencies and aid groups say the hostilities, the Israeli military&rsquo;s refusal to facilitate deliveries and the breakdown of order inside Gaza make it increasingly difficult to get vital aid to much of the coastal enclave. In some cases, crowds of desperate Palestinians have surrounded delivery trucks and stripped the supplies off them.</p>
<p>The U.N. has called on Israel to open more crossings, including in the north, and to improve the coordination process.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-26 16:24:48,2024-02-26 16:44:40

<p>Netanyahu&rsquo;s office said that the War Cabinet had approved a plan to deliver humanitarian aid safely into Gaza in a way that would &ldquo;prevent the cases of looting.&rdquo; It did not disclose further details.</p>
<p>The war, launched after Hamas-led militants rampaged across southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 people hostage, has caused vast devastation in Gaza.</p>
<p>Nearly 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which does not distinguish in its count between fighters and noncombatants. Israel says it has killed 10,000 militants, without providing evidence.</p>
<p>Fighting has flattened large swaths of Gaza's urban landscape, displacing about 80% of the territory&rsquo;s 2.3 million people, who have crammed into increasingly smaller spaces looking for elusive safety.</p>
<p>The crisis has pushed a quarter of the population toward starvation and raised fears of imminent famine, especially in the northern part of Gaza, the first focus of Israel&rsquo;s ground invasion. Starving residents have been forced to eat animal fodder and search for food in demolished buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish death for the children because I cannot get them bread. I cannot feed them. I cannot feed my own children!"" Naim Abouseido yelled as he waited for aid in Gaza City. ""What did we do to deserve this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bushra Khalidi with U.K. aid organization Oxfam told The Associated Press that it had verified reports that children have died of starvation in the north in recent weeks, which she said indicated aid was not being scaled up despite the court ruling.</p>
<p>Aid groups say deliveries also continue to be hobbled by security issues. The French aid groups M&eacute;decins du Monde and Doctors Without Borders each said that their facilities were struck by Israeli forces in the weeks following the court order.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-27 08:25:46,2024-02-27 10:05:56
Dhaka’s air 2nd worst in the world this morning,Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6360802.webp,Environment,,Dhaka’s air 2nd worst in the world this morning,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:1472:""<p>Dhaka has ranked second on the list of cities worldwide with the worst air quality with an AQI index of 181 at 9 am this morning (February 27, 2024).</p>
<p>Dhaka&rsquo;s air was classified as 'unhealthy', according to the air quality index.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi occupied the first, third and fourth spots on the list, with AQI scores of 183, 178 and 171 respectively.</p>
<p>When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 101 and 150, air quality is considered &lsquo;unhealthy for sensitive groups&rsquo;, between 150 and 200 is &lsquo;unhealthy&rsquo;, between 201 and 300 is said to be 'very unhealthy', while a reading of 301+ is considered 'hazardous', posing serious health risks to residents.</p>
<p>The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them.</p>
<p>The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone.</p>
<p>Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon.</p>
<p>As per World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-27 09:33:37,

<p>Speaking at the inauguration of Police Week-2024 in Dhaka&rsquo;s Rajarbagh Police Lines, she outlined the vision of a developed and prosperous Bangladesh reliant on robust law enforcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our operation against militancy, terrorism, drugs, and corruption will persist. The police must play a proactive role. The peace and stability of our country are paramount for achieving our developmental goals,&rdquo; the Prime Minister stated.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Police Week, bearing the theme &lsquo;Smart police smart country, Bangladesh of peace and progress,&rsquo; will run until March 3, reflecting a commitment to modernizing the force to better serve the nation.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Hasina also called on the police to bolster their image as &ldquo;friends of the people&rdquo; through professionalism, sincerity, and competence. She emphasized the long-standing principle of the police as a beacon of hope and assistance for the public in times of need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the country&rsquo;s citizens face danger, they turn to the police. It is crucial to reinforce this bond of trust,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister asked police to earn people&rsquo;s trust and confidence. &ldquo;People of the country can now trust police. We want you to serve the people with more sincerity,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She recalled the patience and professionalism demonstrated by police in tackling arson violence, vandalism and killings unleashed by BNP-Jamaat during the 2013-2015 period and towards the end of 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police tackled the situation with utmost patience. I sincerely thank them for the patience they demonstrated,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Appreciating their role in the United Nations peacekeeping missions, the premier thanked the Bangladesh Police for their contribution to maintaining world peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focusing on her government&rsquo;s measures and success in modernizing the Bangladesh Police force since 2009, Sheikh Hasina said the government formed Anti-Terrorism Unit (ATU) and Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime Unit (CTTC) to eradicate militancy and terrorism.</p>
<p>She also recalled that her government formed the Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI), Highway Police, Industrial Police, Tourist Police, Naval Police, Special Security and Protection Battalion, and MRT Police to address crimes.</p>
<p>DNA lab, modern forensic lab, automated fingerprint identification system (AFIS) and chemical laboratory have already been set up for Bangladesh Police, she said, adding that all these labs and resources are functional in some divisional cities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We plan to set up such labs in every division in the future,&rdquo; said the Prime Minister.</p>

"Robi’s call drop rate lowest in the country, CEO says",Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/1899761.webp,Special,,"Robi’s call drop rate lowest in the country, CEO says","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:10063:""<p>Rajeev Sethi assumed the role of Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Robi Axiata in October 2022. Prior to this, he was associated with the mobile operator Ooredoo in Myanmar. He also served as the Chief Commercial Officer of Airtel Africa. His professional journey includes leadership roles in renowned companies like Vodafone, HP, Hutchison Telecom, and Asian Paints. An MBA specializing in marketing, finance, and operations, Sethi&rsquo;s familiarity with Bangladesh is not recent. He has previously held the position of CEO at GrameenPhone. In an exclusive interview with UNB, Sethi talked about Robi&rsquo;s growth, his experience in the telecom sector in Bangladesh and more.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Robi recorded a 16 percent leap in its revenue in FY 2023. Profits also went up by 74 percent. Can you elaborate on that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Setting records isn&rsquo;t necessarily crucial. It&rsquo;s common for expanding businesses to break their own revenue records annually. However, what stands out is Robi&rsquo;s impressive rate of business expansion in 2023. The company saw its highest revenue and profit growth in its 27-year history that year. Furthermore, Robi&rsquo;s 2023 growth outpaced all other telecom companies in Bangladesh. Based on the data available for mobile operators in the Asia and Pacific region, Robi&rsquo;s growth was unmatched.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What do you believe contributed to this success?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It&rsquo;s the outcome of persistent endeavours. We&rsquo;ve significantly enhanced our network. I can confidently state that Robi currently has the superior network for both voice calls and internet usage. This is a key factor in our success.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve simplified our internet and minute packages to be user-friendly. We&rsquo;ve strived to provide packages that cater to our subscribers&rsquo; preferences. Our branding efforts have also been successful. We&rsquo;ve launched a new branding campaign called &ldquo;Parbe tumio&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The positive business results are the culmination of all these efforts.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Why hasn&rsquo;t Robi, despite being operational since 1997, been able to generate profits at the same level as its competitors?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> There are multiple factors at play. The game is all about numbers and reach. The higher the subscriber count, the greater the revenue and profit. More subscribers translate to reduced operational costs per subscriber. Given the current state of the telecom sector, it&rsquo;s challenging for smaller operators to boost their profits.</p>
<p>Globally, various steps are taken to safeguard these smaller entities. This issue was also brought up in Bangladesh a few years back, but no effective measures were implemented. It&rsquo;s not just about the profit or loss of any single operator. If a monopoly exists in the market, the subscribers are the ones who stand to lose.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Having had experience in the telecom sector of Bangladesh, what is your evaluation of the sector&rsquo;s regulations, policies, and other rules?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> This question can be approached in several ways. One perspective is that the telecom sector in this country is an attractive investment opportunity due to the high population density, which is beneficial for establishing telecom infrastructure. A significant part of the population is young and eager for new experiences. Many homes without broadband connections present further opportunities for the telecom sector. However, the sector is burdened with extremely high taxes. For every 100 taka earned, 56 goes to the government &ndash; a rate that is double compared to neighbouring countries. The absence of a unified license to offer telecom services at various levels means that a company cannot independently provide all services and must rely on the tower company. This dependency not only increases costs but also impacts the quality of service.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: As an Indian living in Bangladesh, how would you compare the network quality of the two countries?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It really hinges on the standard of comparison. However, I can affirm that the network quality I experience in Dhaka surpasses that in Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: There are complaints from consumers in Bangladesh about the service quality. Specific issues include lack of network coverage at home and call drops. What&rsquo;s your perspective on this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It&rsquo;s common for people to voice their complaints on social media when they&rsquo;re dissatisfied with a service, rather than when they&rsquo;re content. Given the millions of calls made daily, a few call drops are inevitable due to the imperfect nature of radio waves. It&rsquo;s important to assess whether the call drop rates exceed both local and international standards. For instance, Robi&rsquo;s call drop rate is 0.3, the lowest in the country. However, we continuously strive to enhance our service. We&rsquo;re attempting to establish towers in certain challenging locations like Ukhia in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, but acquiring the necessary land for tower setup presents its own set of difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Isn&rsquo;t there also a need to augment the number of towers in Dhaka?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Definitely. We have the equipment to establish approximately 600 towers, but they&rsquo;re currently unused in our warehouse due to space constraints. We&rsquo;re in talks with regulatory bodies and tower companies. The idea of sharing towers seems promising, and we&rsquo;re exploring that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What strategies can be employed to boost internet usage in Bangladesh?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> The majority of individuals in Bangladesh access the internet via their smartphones. To boost internet usage, it&rsquo;s crucial to make smartphones more affordable; they are currently quite expensive in this country. Local firms have begun producing smartphones, and it&rsquo;s worth exploring how to reduce their prices.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: The government is discussing the implementation of high-speed 5G internet service. Are the service providers prepared, and is there a market demand for 5G?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> In terms of service providers, we are indeed prepared for 5G. However, the market readiness is a separate issue. For the average user, 5G won&rsquo;t significantly alter their experience, as it will be similar to their current internet movie-watching experience. The real need for 5G lies in the industrial and service sectors. The extent of automation in these sectors needs to be evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Why did Robi recently establish two subsidiary firms, Axentec and r-ventures?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to cater to business entities. Currently, the revenue from this sector is minimal, but it&rsquo;s expected to grow as services expand in the future. With a forward-looking approach, a new company has been established and a new CEO has been appointed. It&rsquo;s noteworthy that similar businesses have seen a significant increase in revenue in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Is Robi considering issuing additional shares in the capital market?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> This falls under the purview of the board of directors. However, to the best of my knowledge, it&rsquo;s not currently being considered.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What would you highlight as the challenges and opportunities of investing in Bangladesh?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Investors prefer a stable policy environment as it facilitates strategic planning. Abrupt alterations in government policies related to investment can cause concern among investors. The presence of a third-party dispute resolution mechanism is crucial in business, a role typically fulfilled by the court. An unbiased judicial system is a fundamental requirement for investment. If one were to select a country for investment in the telecom sector, Bangladesh would be a prime choice. The country offers numerous advantages for investment.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What is your perception of Bangladeshis after working here for an extended period of time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> I have a deep affection for Bangladesh. People here are incredibly amicable and possess a keen interest in gaining knowledge and learning. Their passion for cricket is evident. This country is brimming with untapped talent that the world is yet to discover. We conducted a talent hunt in the digital sector and were astounded by the exceptional young talents we found. Unlike me, who is in the 40 to 50 age bracket, these are young individuals aged around 25 to 30. They require an appropriate platform to showcase their abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Robi&rsquo;s Financial Facts for 2023</strong></p>
<p>Robi reported a revenue of approximately Tk 99.42 billion and a post-tax profit of Tk 3.21 billion. The total investment since the company&rsquo;s inception is Tk 380 billion. The company boasts a subscriber base of 55.7 million. It was listed on the stock market on December 24, 2020, with a share market value of Tk 31.20 and offers a cash dividend of 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Brief overview of Robi</strong></p>
<p>The Axiata Group Berhad, based in Malaysia, holds a 61.82% stake in Robi. Bharti Airtel from India owns 28.18% of the shares, while the remaining 10% is held by general shareholders in Bangladesh. The company was jointly launched in 1997 by Telecom Malaysia and AK Khan and Company of Bangladesh under the brand name Aktel. In 2008, AK Khan and Company sold their shares. The company underwent a rebranding in 2010, changing its name from Aktel to Robi.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-27 12:21:07,2024-02-27 17:02:40

Pakistan’s Imran Khan and his wife appear in court and plead not guilty in another graft case,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Asia/131628,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/8389354.webp,World,Asia,Pakistan’s Imran Khan and his wife appear in court and plead not guilty in another graft case,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3508:""<p>Pakistan's imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife appeared in a court near Islamabad on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty in a graft case alleging they accepted the gift of land from a real estate tycoon in exchange for large sums of laundered money, officials said.</p>
<p>The case is the second to indict Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over acts of corruption allegedly committed while the former cricket star turned Islamist politician was in office.</p>
<p>Prosecutors accuse the couple of using their family’s charity to set up a university on land gifted to them by the tycoon, Malik Riaz. In turn, the businessman was allegedly given 190 million British pounds ($240 million) in laundered money that was returned to Pakistan by British authorities.</p>

<p>Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in parliament in April 2022, is currently serving multiple prison terms and has some 170 legal cases pending against him on charges ranging from corruption to inciting people to violence and terrorism. The couple has also been convicted earlier in a graft case on charges of selling state gifts while in office.</p>
<p>Khan has denied wrongdoing and has insisted since his arrest last year that all the charges against him are a plot by his rivals to keep him from returning to office.</p>
<p>He was barred from running in the Feb. 8 parliamentary elections in which his rivals from the Pakistan Muslim League party, or PML-N, emerged as the largest in the National Assembly or lower house of the parliament. Khan's rival, former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is now on track to form a coalition government when the parliament meets for its inaugural session on Friday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Khan was brought before the judge at the high security court set up inside the Adiala Prison, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi just outside Islamabad, where he is serving his prison terms concurrently.</p>
<p>Bibi, who is imprisoned at the couple's home in Islamabad, was brought to the court in a security convoy. The couple pleaded not guilty after the latest charge was read to them and the judge adjourned the proceedings till next month, Khan's legal team said.</p>
<p>Separately, Khan and Bibi have also been sentenced to seven years in prison each on charges that their 2018 wedding violated marriage laws, allegedly because insufficient time had lapsed between Bibi's previous divorce and their union.</p>

<p>Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party condemned Tuesday's proceedings as “one sided” and complained because Khan's legal team has had limited access to him and because the media have been barred from covering the trial.</p>
<p>Khan has so far been convicted on charges of corruption, revealing official secrets and violating marriage laws in three separate verdicts and sentenced to 10, 14 and seven years respectively. Under Pakistani law, he is to serve the terms concurrently — meaning, the length of the longest of the sentences.</p>
<p>Khan is appealing all the convictions.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-27 18:04:20,2024-02-27 18:29:14

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Towfiqul Islam Khan, senior research fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) told UNB that in Bangladesh once the price is up it never goes down.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As an example, he said that in 2013, rice was selling at Tk 36 per kg. It increased to Tk 70 in 2022. In the fiscal year 2023-24, it jumped to Tk80-85 per kg. Similarly, the prices of meat, poultry chicken, soybean oil, eggs, and almost all daily commodities have increased.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Besides, ‘’The rate of inflation has increased over time. The average inflation rate from 2012 to 2022 was 6.05 percent per year. The inflation rate in 2023 was calculated at 9.02 percent, while the second-highest rate of the decade was 9.93 percent in last October. In this case, the rate of food inflation is higher,’’ he pointed out.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to a 2023 report from the World Bank 71 percent of Bangladeshi families are currently worried about the increase in food prices. In addition, rising commodity prices are limiting or reducing the purchasing power of people.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The executive director of the Policy Research Institute (PRI) said that the central bank is taking initiatives late and implementation of those measures is also getting delayed. As a result the policy on the economy is not working.</p>

FAO supports Bangladesh in strengthening pesticide regulations,Kazi Farzana Haque,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Foreign Affairs/131642,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6513594.webp,Bangladesh,Foreign Affairs,FAO supports Bangladesh in strengthening pesticide regulations,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5022:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has officially handed over its recommendations on the pesticide rules to the Department of Agricultural Extension under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Representatives from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change participated in a workshop held on Tuesday on collaboration in relevant component of the projects.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saso Martinov, Senior Technical Advisor, FAO Bangladesh and Dr Fahmida Khanom, Additional Secretary (Development) of&nbsp; the ministry participated&nbsp; in the event.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&nbsp; was chaired by Ashraf Uddin, Director, Plant Protection Wing, Department of Agricultural Extension.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The government of Bangladesh, in collaboration with FAO, is taking crucial steps to update the Pesticide Rules under the Pesticide Act of 2018, prioritizing public health and environmental protection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This collaborative effort aims to incorporate international best legal practices into the pesticide regulations and ensure the safe and responsible use of these chemicals in the country. The initiative is done under the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) project that is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saso Martinov, Senior Technical Advisor, FAO stated that, &ldquo;This is an important step in managing pesticides that are used in agriculture in Bangladesh. FAO team has handed over its recommendation on the pesticide rules today and will continue to support the Government of Bangladesh in its efforts to reduce the risks of pesticides following FAO&rsquo;s 4 Betters including a better life and a better environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dr Fahmida Khanom, Additional Secretary (Development), MoEFCC highlighted FAO&rsquo;s support in Bangladesh's achievement of becoming free from DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and said &ldquo;The government now wants to focus heavily on proper handling and recycling of toxic pesticide containers and the recommendations will work as a buffer for future activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One key focus area of the Pesticide Rules is the transparent and comprehensive pesticide registration process, overseen by the Director of the Plant Protection Wing of the Department of Agricultural Extension under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A great majority of citizens of Bangladesh rely on agriculture for food security.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Improper pesticide use can lead to residues exceeding safe limits on food crops, posing health risks to consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, unregulated pesticide use can harm beneficial insects, pollute water sources, and contaminate soil, jeopardizing biodiversity and ecosystem health. Stringent registration enables evaluation of potential environmental impacts as well as risks to human health before allowing pesticides into the market for consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">FAO Recommendations aim to implement more strict measures to prevent the infiltration of highly hazardous pesticides into the market.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This includes rigorous assessments of potential risks to human health and the environment before granting registration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The initiative prioritizes safe and responsible pesticide waste disposal. FAO Recommendations would incorporate robust regulations to ensure proper collection, transportation, and treatment of pesticide waste, minimizing the risk of environmental contamination.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recognizing the environmental impact of pesticide packaging, the project also provides guidance on its management in line with the Environment Conservation Act of 1995 and the Solid Waste Management Rules of 2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This will promote environmentally responsible packaging practices and contribute to a cleaner and healthier Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Implementing the updated Pesticide Rules requires concrete action.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A nationwide collection program for pesticide containers supported by FAO, coupled with awareness campaigns and incentives, will ensure responsible disposal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Training inspectors and empowering local authorities will strengthen enforcement, also engaging farmers through education programmes promoting safe handling and application, protecting themselves and the environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These crucial steps would pave the way for a healthier Bangladesh where responsible pesticide use safeguards public health and the environment.</p>

‘The links between Singapore and Bangladesh go back a long time‘ - George Yeo,Shayan S Khan,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/3363850.webp,Special,,‘The links between Singapore and Bangladesh go back a long time‘ - George Yeo,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:12038:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ex-foreign minister of Singapore and leading thinker on contemporary strategic affairs George Yeo made waves recently when he said Bangladesh should focus less on the Rohingya issue in order to get closer to ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Speaking as part of the Cosmos Foundation&rsquo;s Distinguished Speaker Series, Yeo had said: ""You need to incorporate the view of ASEAN, while not dismissing the importance of the Rohingya issue but also not allowing it to become such a dominating issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When I met him for a one-on-one interview a few days later, I started with this issue, in case there was anything he would like to clarify.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;My point is it is good for ASEAN and Bangladesh to come closer together. It will open up more options and opportunities for Bangladesh. And it is not good if everytime Bangladesh meets ASEAN, the sole dominating issue is the Rohingya problem,&rdquo; he said, before adding: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that it is not important. I understand that it is important, and deeply distressing for Bangladesh, but everytime Bangladesh meets ASEAN, the meeting should not become confined to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Apart from that, he doesn&rsquo;t believe there are too many obstacles standing in the way of Bangladesh and ASEAN getting closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;I understand there is a free trade agreement being negotiated between Bangladesh and Singapore. I hope that can be concluded quickly, it&rsquo;ll be good for both sides. And I think Bangladesh should try to have a free trade agreement with all of ASEAN, because it will be mutually beneficial,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On ASEAN&rsquo;s own plans of expansion, Yeo said: &ldquo;ASEAN doesn&rsquo;t want to draw lines that are permanent. We do not want to get embroiled in the politics of East Asia, neither do we want to get embroiled in the politics of South Asia, where you have all kinds of problems that have no easy solutions. We want to concentrate on the things we share in common, like economic development. More economics than politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>But is there a move towards a more political orientation in recent times?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yeo said ASEAN has always had a political objective.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;It was established during the Cold War, in order to keep what was South East Asia at the time neutral and peaceful. It means we don&rsquo;t interfere in each other&rsquo;s politics. When Thailand has a coup, we take an understanding approach. When Indonesia went through a very tumultuous transition in 1998, ASEAN again took a very understanding attitude. Vietnam and Laos are Marxist-Communists. Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei are majority Muslim, Philippines is Catholic, some are democracies, Brunei is an absolute monarchy - so we learned to accept diversity. We try not to interfere. But if someone pushes us, we will say, don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The conversation then moved to cover more personal aspects of his career. Yeo&rsquo;s career in service of Singapore had spanned the army, the air force, and then politics. <strong>How would he sum up his experience?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;I went to the army because I took an army scholarship, Singapore has national service. I was in Army Signals. I became a Signals officer after attending three months of military training with the US Army. It was fun. Then after Staff College, I was asked to go to the Airforce. Which was very difficult. I like to laugh and say it traumatised me, and it traumatised the airforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Politics was very different. You sit there with people, of different shapes and sizes. You can&rsquo;t force people, you&rsquo;ve got to persuade people, in order to manage conflicts and tensions. So I had 23 years in different ministries, which looking back, was interesting, often enjoyable, always stressful. But it was a different phase of my life, and I&rsquo;m glad to have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yeo headed at least 5 different ministries during his time in politics, and even though he became most well-known for his stint as the foreign minister from 2004-11, he regards his time as minister of information and the arts as the most challenging.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After leaving government service, Yeo was well known to have succeeded Amartya Sen as the second chancellor of Nalanda University, the project to revive the ancient seat of Buddhist learning that was once reputedly the largest university in the world. It was a project he was involved in since 2007, but was forced to quit in December 2016, as it got embroiled in the complexities of Indian politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a statement at the time, he said that when he joined the institute, he was &ldquo;repeatedly assured that the University would have autonomy. This appears not to be the case now&rdquo;. He was appointed to the post in July 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He talks about the project with fondness, clearly taken in by its historic dimensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Nalanda goes back to when I was trade minister, because one day there was a visit by Lal Advani, deputy prime minister of India. And he wanted to know how India could grow quickly. So I suggested promoting Buddhist tourism, and later he got their minister of tourism to visit me in Singapore, and I got to learn about the different sites - I was invited to the ceremony when The Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;I thought Nalanda was such a powerful symbol, because it was once the biggest university in the world. It attracted monks from China, from Japan, Korea, south-east Asia, and wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful to revive it as a secular university? So I suggested this to Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, he asked me to write a paper, and he showed it to Manmohan Singh (India&rsquo;s government had changed from BJP back to Congress), the Indian cabinet felt it was a good idea and asked Amartya Sen to chair a mentors group.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Through the experience I got to learn about the history of Atisa (Atish Dipankar), whose birthplace in Bikrampur I visited four days ago. For me, my years in Nalanda were an education. Enriched me, I learned so many things, made so many friends. Amartya Sen is such a brilliant man. So I succeeded him as the second chancellor. By that time the BJP had taken over, and he had opposed Modi, so it was thought&nbsp; he should not stand for a second term. So I became the chancellor.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Then I saw the university become embroiled in matters of Indian politics. And I&rsquo;m not Indian, so I thought it was best for me to resign. I have friends in both the Congress and the BJP. Even when I negotiated CECA with the BJP, I kept Sonia Gandhi briefed through Montek Singh. So I&rsquo;ve always been close to both sides, and didn&rsquo;t want to be involved in that, so I resigned.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Is there a sense of disappointment in him, at how the project has turned out?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Of course. Otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have resigned,&rdquo; he says resolutely.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We then moved on to the defining conflict of the 21st century: the US-China rivalry, and how it was forcing nations to&nbsp; take sides on so many issues. How is Singapore resisting that?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Singapore is three-quarters Chinese, ethnically. But it has very close links to the US. FOr example when I was in the Air Force, most of the equipment we bought was from the US. And militarily, economically, we have very close ties. We have very deep links to the US. And among the ministers, many will have been educated in the US. I spent two years at Harvard Business School. And three months with the US Army, as a signals officer. But with the Chinese we have these ethnic links.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;So Singapore doesn&rsquo;t want to choose. So we tell them, we can&rsquo;t choose. It has to be case by case. And related to Singapore&rsquo;s interests. We cannot affect how they relate to one another. Maybe we have a few drops of influence - but only a few drops.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>But isn&rsquo;t Singapore known to punch above its weight?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that phrase - because it&rsquo;s a bit unwise to punch above your weight. You should punch below your weight. Then you have a better chance of succeeding. So Singapore tries to punch below its weight I&rsquo;d say. What does this mean? For example, the mainland Chinese and Taiwanese want to meet at a high level, they meet in Singapore. Why? Because they know Singapore is friendly. Singapore does not take sides. Singapore does not tell them what to do. We just let them meet, ove tea, or coffee, and we say good luck!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll notice President Trump and Kim Jong Il, when they met, they met in Singapore. And they almost didn&rsquo;t inform Singapore! They just assumed Singapore would agree. And of course it was an honour for Singapore. So this is Singapore&rsquo;s role - to be a friend. To be helpful. Of course we work in our self-interest. But long term, we are not trying to just make money overnight. We want to cultivate long term relationships.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>We then moved on to the relationship between Bangladesh and Singapore.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;With Bangladesh it&rsquo;s a very deep relationship. The links between Singapore and Bangladesh go back a long time. The British East India Company established Singapore from Kolkata. Then when you had the Bengal Presidency, Singapore was part of that. So in very interesting ways, Bengal was always connected to SIngapore. We view Bangladesh in terms of these profound links of history and we hope Bangladesh sees it in those same terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As mentioned earlier, he had managed to visit Atish Dipankar&rsquo;s birthplace in Bikrampur, present day Munshiganj. But he feels Bangladesh has a long way to go in promoting the Buddhist Tourism Trail in the country, even though it has a lot of potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;You know, I knew nothing about these other sites (Mahasthangarh, Paharpur). I found out about Bikrampur, and said I want to go. And when I was there, I was told there are these even bigger sites nearby. I did not know about them. They are not promoted. In Bikrampur the facilities are poor. It&rsquo;s also difficult to get to. So how can you have a tourism site?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;It would also be important to promote Bangladesh as not simply an Islamic country. Of course it is a Muslim country, and the majority is Muslim. But there are also Hindus, and Buddhists, and Christians. And your national anthem was written by Tagore. All these things have to be part of the presentation of Bangladesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dhaka&rsquo;s air was classified as 'very unhealthy', posing serious health risks to residents, according to the air quality index.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">China&rsquo;s Shenyang, Kyrgyzstan&rsquo;s Bishkek, and China&rsquo;s Wuhan occupied the second, third and fourth spots on the list, with AQI scores of 194, 176 and 169 respectively.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 101 and 150, air quality is considered &lsquo;unhealthy for sensitive groups&rsquo;, between 150 and 200 is &lsquo;unhealthy&rsquo;, between 201 and 300 is said to be 'very unhealthy', while a reading of 301+ is considered 'hazardous', posing serious health risks to residents.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone.</p>

Construction of Dhaka Airport’s Third Terminal set to be fully complete by April 5,Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/9354979.webp,Special,,Construction of Dhaka Airport’s Third Terminal set to be fully complete by April 5,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:2:{i:0;s:2135:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a significant development for Bangladesh&rsquo;s aviation sector, the construction of the third terminal at Dhaka&rsquo;s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) is slated to be fully completed by April 5, 2024, with the terminal expected to be fully operational by October. This marks a pivotal moment in the expansion and modernization of the country&rsquo;s aviation infrastructure.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) will take over the terminal&rsquo;s responsibilities from the contractor once the construction is completed. This transition will initiate the process of moving operations from the old terminals to the new one, focusing on Operational Readiness and Airport Transfer (ORAT) project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">AKM Maksudul Islam, the project director, told UNB that nearly all construction work, including civil engineering tasks, is nearing completion. Any remaining work is expected to be finalized in the first week of April, ensuring a smooth handover to CAAB by April 6. Preparations are underway to fully launch the terminal&rsquo;s operations in October, including the completion of system integration and calibration tasks, which have successfully passed multiple evaluations.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman, Chairman of CAAB, informed UNB that the third terminal is almost ready for flight operations and is expected to be fully functional by October. The completion of this terminal will significantly increase Dhaka airport&rsquo;s capacity, facilitating the growth of domestic and international airlines&rsquo; operations. This expansion is anticipated to improve passenger amenities, increase revenue, and enhance the airport&rsquo;s overall efficiency.</p>"";i:1;s:3473:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The CAAB chairman highlighted the Prime Minister&rsquo;s directive to expedite the project, noting that the work has been completed ahead of schedule, within the allocated budget, and without compromising quality. The third terminal is equipped with state-of-the-art machinery to ensure superior service quality for passengers, aiming to accommodate an increase in both domestic and international travellers, which will, in turn, boost revenue.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The expansion of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, including the construction of the third terminal, was approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) on October 24, 2017, with the first revised development project proposal approved on December 10, 2019, for BDT 21,399 crore. The construction contract was awarded to the Aviation Dhaka Consortium, which includes Japan&rsquo;s Mitsubishi and Fujita, and South Korea&rsquo;s Samsung, based on a design by internationally renowned architect Rohani Baharin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The soft opening of the third terminal by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on October 7, 2023 marked a significant milestone. Once fully completed, the new terminal will more than double Dhaka airport&rsquo;s capacity to handle aircraft and increase annual passenger throughput from 8 million to 20 million, transforming it into a bustling hub and increasing revenue.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Biman Bangladesh Airlines and other domestic airlines are planning to increase flight operations with the inauguration of the third terminal. Foreign airlines have also shown interest in expanding their services. The third terminal will be connected to the metro rail and the Dhaka Elevated Expressway, providing seamless access for passengers and enhancing the Dhaka airport&rsquo;s capacity to serve as a regional aviation hub.</p>

<p>The approval came from the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at her office here in the city.</p>
<p>As per the proposed law, non-resident individuals or foreign firms, who will invest here, can open offshore bank accounts, said Cabinet Secretary Mahbub Hossain while briefing reporters at Bangladesh Secretariat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A license from Bangladesh Bank is required to do offshore banking. Those who have obtained this license do not need to have a new license,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The offshore banking operations can be done with the five currencies &ndash;US Dollar, Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen and Chinese Yen.</p>
<p>Any relative of a Bangladeshi living abroad can open an account and manage the account as a supporter.</p>
<p>Now foreigners who deposit money under the internal banking system of Bangladesh, need permission to remit the money from the country. But in the case of offshore banking, they can do it freely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We hope that those who will benefit from doing business here will be interested in depositing their money here,&rdquo; said the Cabinet Secretary.</p>
<p>Mahbub Hossain said the move for offshore banking is not only to increase reserves but also to gain financial benefit.</p>

<p>The prime minister was responding to a written question from ruling party MP (Bhola) Ali Azam during PM&rsquo;s question answer session in the House.</p>
<p>She said the measures already taken by the government will provide relief to the poor families, including elderly persons, widows, women left by husbands and low income groups.</p>

<p>Hasina, the leader of the House, said that the present government is the people's government. So the government is always trying to ease the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government is doing everything to maintain normal prices of essential consumer goods. We have already managed to contain the abnormal rise in consumer prices to a large extent,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The WTO's (World Trade Organisation) 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) has begun on Monday and it will end on Thursday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Ministers from across the world are attending the conference to review the functioning of the multilateral trading system and to take action on the future work of the WTO.</p>
<p>Three of the NGO representatives were briefly detained on various allegations in the first two days of the conference. One of them is an Indian peasant leader, who handed a paper to a journalist he knew. He was immediately arrested for allegedly distributing leaflets inside the convention centre, a detainable offence.</p>
<p>Two other non-government delegates from Norway and the United States were detained for taking pictures inside the convention centre. The security personnel also stopped leaflet distribution, confiscated placards, and stopped them from taking photos of their own actions, according to a press release received here on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The WTO Director General, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has billed this ministerial meeting as the most &ldquo;open, transparent and inclusive process&rdquo; to date. Yet her institution is failing to ensure participants that the guiding information communicated by the WTO, and the prevailing practice with regards to what civil society can do, actually holds for MC13, Ms James added.</p>
<p>""Participants, especially from developing countries, are fearful of even walking alone in the conference centre now, lest they be unjustly detained and possibly deported, and then unable to secure visas ever again. This climate of fear should not be the result of advocacy in an institution of global economic governance,"" said Rahmat Maulana Sidik, executive director of Indonesia for Global Justice, according to the release.</p>

The introduction of this modern transit option has led to a sharp decline in bus ridership, with operators reporting a 30-40% reduction in the number of buses on this route.</p>
<p>Transport proprietors are bracing for a further decline in bus numbers as the warmer months approach, predicting that the allure of the metro&rsquo;s air-conditioned comfort will draw even more commuters away from buses. The diminished appeal of buses, once a staple for Dhaka&rsquo;s commuters, is particularly noticeable during peak metro operational hours, despite an observable decrease in traffic congestion.</p>

<p>The potential extension of metro rail service hours beyond the current 7:10 am to 8:40 pm timeframe threatens to exacerbate the financial strain on bus operations, prompting owners to consider rerouting their fleets or selling them off. &ldquo;From a daily tally of 500-600 buses, we&rsquo;ve plummeted to just 300-400 buses on the Mirpur-Agargaon-Farmgate-Paltan route,&rdquo; stated Md Shahjahan, Managing Director of Shikhor Paribahan, highlighting the scale of the downturn.</p>"";i:1;s:2141:""<p>Shikhor Paribahan, which previously operated up to 90 buses daily, has seen its fleet reduce to 60-65. Similarly, Bikalpa Auto Service has halved its operations, from 40-50 buses to merely 20-25, according to Managing Director Mahbubur Rahman. This trend has left employees like Aminul Islam, a bus helper for Shikhor Paribahan, fearing for their livelihoods as passenger numbers dwindle.</p>
<p>While CNG-run autorickshaws and bike ride-sharing services have also felt the metro rail&rsquo;s competitive pressure, their income reductions have been less severe. However, for commuters like Ashraful Alam, the metro&rsquo;s efficiency outweighs any cost savings offered by buses, with the metro rail slashing his travel time to Motijheel dramatically.</p>

<p>He also added that traffic movement has become faster on the Uttara-Airport-Mohakhali route due to metro rail services and the opening of Elevated Expressway, despite congestion persisting in other parts of the city.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s phased inauguration of the metro rail&rsquo;s sections &ndash; the Uttara-Agargaon segment in December 2022 and the Agargaon-Motijheel section in November 2023 &ndash; has introduced a new era of commuting in Dhaka. With extended operational hours implemented since January 2024, the metro offers a 30-minute commute from Uttara to Motijheel, presenting a compelling alternative to traditional bus travel amidst Dhaka&rsquo;s notorious traffic congestion.</p>

<p>Lawmakers from Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party repeatedly chanted ""Vote-thief!&rdquo; as Shehbaz Sharif, who's expected to form the government, entered the lower house of parliament with his brother Nawaz Sharif. Both men are former premiers.</p>
<p>Outgoing National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf administered the oath to incoming legislators at noon.</p>
<p>The house echoed with chants of &ldquo;Long Live Sharif!&rdquo; when the brothers signed the register after taking their oaths of office. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the young chairman of the Pakistan People&rsquo;s Party and a key Sharif ally, was met with similar chants.</p>
<p>The new government will face challenges including a surge in militant attacks and shortages of energy; as well as an ailing economy that will force Pakistan to seek another bailout from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from Khan's PTI told reporters that they will continue their campaign against the rigging in the elections in and outside the parliament.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/World/pakistans-imran-khan-and-his-wife-appear-in-court-and-plead-not-guilty-in-another-graft-case/131628"">Pakistan&rsquo;s Imran Khan and his wife appear in court and plead not guilty in another graft case</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the election has been rigged,&rdquo; said Gohar Ali Khan, the current head of PTI.</p>
<p>PTI has called for nationwide rallies on Saturday. The party claims it results were changed in dozens of constituencies to prevent it from winning a majority, a charge the Election Commission of Pakistan denies.</p>
<p>After the Feb. 8 elections, observers from the Commonwealth praised election officials for holding the vote despite multiple militant attacks, but the U.S. State Department said that the vote was held under restrictions of freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly. The European Union also criticized the inability of some political actors to contest the elections. Pakistan&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry has fired back at such criticism, saying the vote was held in a free, fair and transparent manner.</p>
<p>None of the foreign observers described widespread vote-stealing.</p>
<p>Sharif&rsquo;s Pakistan Muslim League party, or PML-N, and Pakistan People&rsquo;s Party of former President Asif Ali Zardari, emerged from the vote as the largest presence in the 336-seat National Assembly, or lower house of the parliament.</p>
<p>Under a power-sharing formula, Sharif's party will support Zardari in next month's presidential elections. Outgoing President Arif Alvi is an ally of Khan and was a senior member of PTI before becoming president.</p>
<p>Khan is currently serving prison terms in multiple cases and has been barred from seeking or holding office. He has been convicted on charges of corruption, revealing official secrets and violating marriage laws in three separate verdicts and sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 10, 14 and 7 years. Khan is appealing all the convictions. He still faces some 170 legal cases on charges ranging from corruption to inciting violence and terrorism.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the PTI wrote a letter to the International Monetary Fund, urging it to link any talks with Islamabad to an audit of the country&rsquo;s recent election, which his party alleges was rigged. The latest development came days before the IMF releases a key installment of a bailout loan to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Khan's move had drawn widespread criticism from his rivals, including Sharif, said Khan wanted to harm the country's economy. Sharif who replaced Khan after his ouster through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 had struggled hard to avoid a default on foreign payments last summer when the IMF approved the much-awaited $3 billion.</p>
<p>Sharif has said he wants a new bailout from the IMF after March when last year's IMF bailout expires.</p>

BAU researchers develop accurate method for identifying livestock diseases,Shayan S Khan,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/2745092.webp,Science,,BAU researchers develop accurate method for identifying livestock diseases,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:4527:""<p>With the use of DNA testing, a Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) research team led by Dr. Md. Shahiduzzaman,Professor of Parasitology, has developed a method for identifying various diseases in livestock caused by blood protozoa with almost one hundred percent accuracy.</p>
<p>Conducted under the auspices of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC), the research initiative involved testing nearly five hundred samples from various farms in Sirajganj and Rangpur to develop this method.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Science/internet-users-in-bangladesh-reach-131-mln-as-of-2023/130756"">Internet users in Bangladesh reach 131 mln as of 2023</a></p>
<p>Dr. Shahiduzzaman informed that in Bangladesh, livestock are particularly susceptible to blood protozoa like Babesia, Theileria, and Anaplasma. These pathogens lead to weight loss, reduced blood and milk production and even death if not treated properly.</p>
<p>Dr. Shahiduzzaman also stated that incorrect diagnosing of these diseases at the field level often leads to incorrect treatment, as symptoms of such diseases are usually similar. In some cases, the presence of pathogens in the blood of infected animals is determined through antibody and antigen tests in the laboratory. However, even with these methods, achieving one hundred percent accurate diagnosis is not always possible.<br /><br />Regarding his disease identification method, Dr. Shahiduzzaman explained that blood samples from animals are first collected, and then DNA is extracted. The extracted DNA is then tested using a PCR machine. Even though a small amount of parasite DNA is present in the sample, it can still be easily detected in this test.</p>
<p>Since the process is sensitive to PCR, almost one hundred percent accurate results can be obtained. The entire process takes three to four hours to complete, and multiple samples can be tested simultaneously. The cost for testing each sample ranges from five hundred to seven hundred taka.<br /><br />In this context, contact has been made with the livestock officers of Sreemangal and Rangpur to provide information to UNB about the current situation of livestock blood parasites and disease diagnosis at the field level.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Science/as-cancer-treatment-advances-patients-and-doctors-push-back-against-drugs-harsh-side-effects/130436"">As cancer treatment advances, patients and doctors push back against drugs' harsh side effects</a><br /><br />Dr. Karna Chandra mallik, Upazila Livestock Officer of Sreemangal Upazila, said that the urine of animals infected with Babesia turns the color of coffee. Although Babesia disease can be diagnosed by examining urine, symptoms of Theileria and Anaplasma cannot be identified by such means.<br /><br />Dr. Md. Zobidul Kabir, Additional District Livestock Officer of Rangpur district, said that the emergence of these three diseases&mdash;Babesia, Theileria, and Anaplasma&mdash;was not as prevalent in Bangladesh in the past. However, in the current context, these diseases have been prominently observed in highly productive livestock breeds in the Rangpur region. Consequently, the production of dairy and livestock products faces challenges.<br /><br />Livestock officers further stated that Anaplasmosis spreads from one animal to another through tick bites. In advanced countries, if a livestock animal is affected by this disease, it is immediately removed from the farm. However, as this method is not prevalent in our country, the rate of infection in cattle farms is significantly higher.<br /><br />They also added that the Field Disease Investigation Laboratory (FDIL) identifies these diseases through the Giemsa staining from blood sample which need skilled manpower. Often, there is uncertainty in identifying Theileria and Anaplasma, and even the results obtained from samples tested in various private diagnostic centers in Rangpur have been confusing.<br /><br />Dr. Zobidul commended Dr. Shahiduzzaman's success, stating that if the DNA method for identifying livestock diseases could be implemented at the field level, it would play a significant role in the development of livestock.<br /><br />Dr. Shahiduzzaman further remarked that as a veterinarian, it is his professional responsibility to enhance the livestock of the country. If this technology is adopted at the field level with the cooperation of the government as well as respective authorities, it will benefit farmers.&nbsp;</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-29 16:15:58,

<p>The four-day MWC began on February 26, with the participation of top technology manufacturers, providers, leaders, and policymakers from around the globe, said a press release.</p>
<p>Officials from the Bangladesh telecom industry, regulatory bodies and other key stakeholders also took part in the mega event. Bangladesh mobile industry leaders discussed some of their initiatives regarding women&rsquo;s empowerment through messages.</p>
<p>Yasir Azman, AMTOB President-Elect and CEO of Grameenphone said, &ldquo;In Bangladesh, where currently 29 percent of mobile internet users are women, we aim to increase this figure to 32 percent by 2026. To achieve this goal, we have initiated two key efforts. One involves educating and enhancing the skills of 2 million vulnerable individuals in Bangladesh, with 60 percent of this target being women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second initiative entails educating 10 million teachers and children on online safety, with 58 percent of this demographic being women and girls. These are the two commitments of Grameenphone aimed at increasing female internet users, he said.</p>
<p>Shihab Ahmad, chief commercial officer, Robi Axiata Limited said, &ldquo;Robi has been part of this initiative with GSMA since 2016. Our commitment to bringing women into the digital world remains a key focus for us at Robi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have initiated Project Khadiza, aimed at fostering female developers to create solutions catering specifically to female customers within our national app store. Additionally, we have launched nationwide programs, targeting households, particularly in rural areas where access to women can be challenging. These initiatives are envisioned to elevate us to a national and industry-wide level, facilitating increased women's participation in the digital sphere. This reflects Robi's commitment to the cause,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Taimur Rahman, chief corporate &amp; regulatory affairs officer, Banglalink said, &ldquo;We currently have approximately 26 percent of women as mobile internet users, and our commitment is to raise this number to nearly 30 percent within the next two years. We strongly believe that without empowering women, the country's development cannot progress. To facilitate this, we have taken initiatives such as developing the ""My BL App,"" where ChatGPT also plays a role, ensuring that women can easily utilize these applications. We have utilized our entire network to support this endeavor.&rdquo;</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-29 20:51:25,
Govt announces new power tariff for bulk consumers raising it by 5 percent,Shayan S Khan,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Others/131760,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/7336666.webp,Bangladesh,Others,Govt announces new power tariff for bulk consumers raising it by 5 percent,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3962:""<p>The government has announced the new power tariff for bulk consumers raising it by 5 percent from existing Tk 6.70 per unit to Tk 7.04 meaning a rise of Tk 0.34 per unit (each kilowatt hour) with effect from February 1.</p>
<p>The bulk consumers are mainly the distribution entities and large industries who receive electricity at 33 kV, 132 kV and 230 kV transmission lines directly from the single buyer and principal organization in the power sector, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).</p>
<p>“So, it will have no effect on the power tariff applicable for the retail consumers until the government announces a new tariff for retail consumers,” a top official of the BPDB told UNB.  </p>
<p>There are six distribution entities—Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB), Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited (DPDC), Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (Desco), Northern Electricity Supply Company PLS (Nesco), West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited (WZPDCL) and also BPDB, which is itself involved in power distribution.</p>
<p>As per a gazette notification, dated February 29, the distribution entities will purchase electricity from BPDB at Tk 8.44 per unit electricity at 230 kV, Tk 8.47 at 132 kV and Tk 7.62 at 33 kV level.</p>
<p>Besides, a separate gazette notification was also issued raising the transmission charge as well for the entities. </p>
<p>Earlier, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid at a press briefing said that power tariff will be increased from February 1 instead of March 1, said on Thursday (February 29, 2024) - meaning the new rates will come into effect retroactively, to cover February bills as well.  </p>
<p>However, two days before, he had said the new tariff will come into effect from March 1.</p>
<p>He said the power tariff will be hiked between Tk 0.34 (5 percent) and Tk 0.70 per unit (8.5 percent) for all kinds of consumers depending on their volume of consumption while gas price will go up by Tk 0.75 per unit only for power plants.  </p>
<p>He also said that a dynamic fuel pricing will be introduced for the consumers from March 1 under which the price of petroleum fuel will go up and down in line with international market price.</p>
<p>“Each month fuel price will be declared for the consumers,"" he said adding neighbouring India does this every day.</p>
<p>He noted that the steps have been taken to minimise the government losses caused by the increase in dollar rate. “This year the government will incur a loss of Tk 43,000 crore due to sale of electricity at lower price,” he said.</p>
<p>This step has been taken as part of the government move to come out of the subsidy now being given to the power sector, said the minister.</p>
<p>According to the BPDB’s Annual Report 2022-23, the fiscal year saw the production of 87,024 million kilowatt hours of electricity at a total cost of TK 98,646 crore.  </p>
<p>Its per unit production cost was Tk 11.33, while it was selling electricity at Tk 6.7 per unit — incurring a loss of about Tk 4.63 per unit.</p>
<p>This imbalance has led to a staggering loss of Tk 47,788 crore for the fiscal year, as the government grapples with purchasing power from private and international sources at significantly higher rates.</p>
<p>With this huge loss, the government has been facing great trouble as it has to purchase electricity worth Tk 82,778 crore from private sector power producers, while it generates electricity worth Tk 13,307 crore from its own generation plants.</p>
<p>The annual report also shows that the BPDB’s average per unit production cost from its own plants is Tk 7.63, while it is Tk 14.62 at the independent power producers or IPPs (private sector), at rental plants Tk 12.53, at public plants Tk 6.85, and imported power from India at Tk 8.77.</p>
<p>The government purchases electricity from the private sector and India in dollars.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-29 20:55:38,2024-02-29 21:56:07

<p>As per a gazette notification, dated February 29, the distribution entities will purchase electricity from BPDB at Tk 8.44 per unit electricity at 230 kV, Tk 8.47 at 132 kV and Tk 7.62 at 33 kV level.</p>
<p>Besides, a separate gazette notification was also issued raising the transmission charge as well for the entities.</p>
<p>Earlier, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid at a press briefing said that the power tariff will be increased from February 1 instead of March 1, on Thursday (February 29, 2024) - meaning the new rates will come into effect retroactively, to cover February bills as well. </p>
<p>However, two days before, he had said the new tariff would come into effect from March 1.</p>
<p>He said the power tariff would be hiked between Tk 0.34 (5 percent) and Tk 0.70 per unit (8.5 percent) for all kinds of consumers depending on their consumption volume while gas price will go up by Tk 0.75 per unit only for power plants. </p>
<p>He also said that dynamic fuel pricing will be introduced for the consumers from March 1 under which the price of petroleum fuel will go up and down in line with international market prices.</p>
<p>“Each month fuel price will be declared for the consumers,"" he said adding neighbouring India does this every day.</p>
<p>He noted that the steps have been taken to minimise the government losses caused by the increase in the dollar rate. “This year the government will incur a loss of Tk 43,000 crore due to the sale of electricity at a lower price,” he said.</p>
<p>This step has been taken as part of the government's move to come out of the subsidy now being given to the power sector, said the minister.</p>
<p>According to the BPDB’s Annual Report 2022-23, the fiscal year saw the production of 87,024 million kilowatt hours of electricity at a total cost of TK 98,646 crore. </p>
<p>Its per unit production cost was Tk 11.33, while it was selling electricity at Tk 6.7 per unit — incurring a loss of about Tk 4.63 per unit.</p>
<p>This imbalance has led to a staggering loss of Tk 47,788 crore for the fiscal year, as the government grapples with purchasing power from private and international sources at significantly higher rates.</p>
<p>With this huge loss, the government has been facing great trouble as it has to purchase electricity worth Tk 82,778 crore from private sector power producers, while it generates electricity worth Tk 13,307 crore from its generation plants.</p>
<p>The annual report also shows that the BPDB’s average per unit production cost from its plants is Tk 7.63. At the same time, it is Tk 14.62 at the independent power producers or IPPs (private sector), at rental plants Tk 12.53, at public plants Tk 6.85, and imported power from India at Tk 8.77.</p>
<p>The government purchases electricity from the private sector and India in dollars.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-29 23:00:43,2024-03-01 01:58:20

Govt issues guideline for introducing automated price of petroleum fuels,Farid Hossain,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/9038970_png.webp,Bangladesh,,Govt issues guideline for introducing automated price of petroleum fuels,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:2701:""<p>The government on Friday issued a &ldquo;Fuel Pricing Guidelines&rdquo; through a gazette notification to set an automated price for the petroleum fuels across the country.</p>
<p>The system will be effective from March.</p>
<p>Under the guidelines, prices of all the petroleum fuels including petrol, diesel, octane, kerosene, furnace oil, jet fuel, marine fuels will be set automatically on the basis of the international market price.</p>
<p>The local prices will go up and down in line with the international price and every month such price will be announced by the government for one-month tenure.</p>
<p>But the automated pricing is not coming into effect from today (March 1) although State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid had said on Thursday that it would be effective from March.</p>
<p>Energy Secretary Md Nurul Alam also said that it won't be effective from today. &ldquo;Since we have not yet received the Prime Minister&rsquo;s approval to make the guideline effective, we&rsquo;ve to wait for some more days&rdquo;, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope, we&rsquo;ll get the PM&rsquo;s approval soon and will bring it into effect within 10-12 days&rdquo;, he told UNB.</p>
<p>The Fuel Pricing Guidelines, however, giving an example for its effectiveness said that if it is planned to make effective from April 1, the prices of fuels of one month in the international market from February 21 to March 20 has to be taken into consideration to set an average price and then set the price for month of April.</p>
<p>About such contradictory instruction in the guideline, the energy secretary said that such automated pricing system is a new thing in Bangladesh. So, the ministry itself is in some confustions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sit with the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) to remove all confusions and make the guideline clear all to all&rdquo;, he said. The BPC is the state agency for importing and marketing of petroleum products across the country.</p>
<p>In case of setting a price for any of the petroleum fuels, all the expenses including the international market price, import tax, advance income tax and valued added tax (VAT), operational expense, finance, administrative and maintenance cost, margins of BPC, VAT, and sale and distribution costs will be taken into account and then set a price.</p>
<p>A source in the Energy Division said that the price of octane will go below the price of diesel as soon as the automated pricing formula is effective. <br />&ldquo;This is also a big concern for the government&rdquo;, he said adding that the government wants to keep the octane price higher than diesel&rdquo;, he added.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-01 12:33:41,
Blaze-hit Bailey Road building had no fire exit: PM Hasina,Farid Hossain,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/PMO/131787,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/4836779_png.webp,Bangladesh,PMO,Blaze-hit Bailey Road building had no fire exit: PM Hasina,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3604:""<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday bemoaned that there was no fire exit in the multi-storied building that caught fire on Bailey Road leaving dozens of people dead.</p>

<p>The prime minister said this while addressing a programme marking 'National Insurance Day-2024' at the Bangabandhu International Conference Center in the capital on Friday jointly organised by Ministry of Finance and the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA) jointly at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre (BICC) aiming to promote the idea of insurance by enhancing public awareness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We always request our architects, at least when they design houses or buildings, keep a small open balcony, a fire exit or a ventilation. But architects who want to build (buildings) will not design that properly and also the owners do not want to leave an inch of space,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Hasina said that 45 people died in Bailey Road fire incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could be more painful than this,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>However, the prime minister said that the government has repeatedly instructed to install fire extinguishers and take fire safety measures in all buildings, but that is hardly followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know there was no insurance, so they (victims in the Bailey Road fire incident) won't get anything (as compensation). Awareness is very much needed in these cases,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The prime minister asked all concerned to take prompt measures to meet the insurance claims at the quickest possible time to encourage people to come under insurance coverage.</p>
<p>""Take measures as the insurance claims of the real people can be paid correctly and quickly,"" she said.</p>
<p>She, however, asked the authority to be watchful about false insurance demand referring to some ready-made garments factories' fraudulence act of causing fire deliberately time and again for claiming false insurance money.<br />She briefly described her government's measures for the overall development of the insurance sector.</p>
<p>She said that her government has been implementing Bangladesh Insurance Sector Development Project.</p>
<p>""Once the project is implemented, professionalism and efficiency in technology in this sector will be flourished further,"" she said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also inaugurated the bankainsurence service that facilitates providing premium of the insurance from the banks directly.</p>
<p>She thanked all concerned to make much easier the insurence process involving banks to this end by which both the banks and insurences can be benefitted.</p>
<p>After introducing the process, people can give their premiums of the insurence through their bank accounts.</p>
<p>The prime minister asked the authorities concerned to settle the insurance claims of the people through the banking channel.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-01 12:58:01,2024-03-01 13:56:48

"Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors, genuine willingness keys to take Dhaka-Washington ties to next stage",Farid Hossain,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6506592.webp,Special,,"Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors, genuine willingness keys to take Dhaka-Washington ties to next stage","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:2:{i:0;s:5693:""<p>Strategic considerations, geopolitical factors and a genuine willingness to broaden ties in new areas will drive forward the Bangladesh-US relations to the next level leaving behind pre-election political differences between the two countries, experts opine viewing post-polls relations.</p>
<p>“Both countries have long and old ties in every aspect of statecraft and bilateral relations. The new chapter denotes that these two countries would deepen their engagement beyond the much-debated political differences,” Prof Shahab Enam Khan of Jahangirnagar University’s Department of International Relations told UNB this week.</p>
<p>A senior US government delegation visited Bangladesh last week with an agenda that included strengthening diplomatic ties and advancing shared interests in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The delegation comprised Eileen Laubacher, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for South Asia, US National Security Council (NSC); Michael Schiffer, USAID Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Asia; and Afreen Akhter, US Department of State Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Their discussions also focused on climate change, trade, the Rohingya refugee crisis, and labor rights. The delegation met with senior officials, business executives, civil society organisations, and top opposition leaders.</p>
<p>Prof Shahab, who is also executive director and CEO at Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs, assumes the issues of Bangladesh’s national security and the Indo-Pacific agenda coincide with the US ones.</p>
<p>Hence, he thinks, the bilateral relations will get new momentum in defense, security, non-traditional security, and human security issues.</p>
<p>“Myanmar, too, is a wake-up call here. This further gives me a sense that the US would not see Bangladesh through any third-country prism,” said the international affairs expert.</p>
<p>Instead, he thinks, both countries may synchronise their mutual interests in the coming days. “Bangladesh, after all, has been the most dependable country for the superpowers as it comes with no fractured ties with the regional neighbours or any hyped-up political or security narratives.”</p>
<p>Prof Shahab said these two factors make Bangladesh a regional security guarantor needed to keep the Indo-Pacific region stable.</p>
<p><strong>A New Chapter and Priorities</strong></p>
<p>Asked about the priority areas in opening a new chapter in their relations with Bangladesh, US Embassy spokesperson Haynes Mahoney said Bangladesh is an Indo-Pacific partner and the United States is Bangladesh’s largest source of foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>“We are committed to working together to ensure the Indo-Pacific region remains free, open, peaceful, and secure. We also engage with Bangladesh on broader sets of priorities,” he told UNB.</p>
<p>“As President Biden has stated, we will look at ways to build on our long-standing partnership to improve economic growth, mitigate climate change, and to invest in people so they have opportunities to lead healthier and more prosperous lives,” Haynes added.</p>
<p>The US is pleased to see Bangladesh’s Indo-Pacific outlook, which he thinks “really mirrors” what they are trying to do in terms of economic investment, working with Bangladesh on climate change, and building out security and defense cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is, of course, one of the largest UN Peacekeeping contributors, and we are very pleased to support that effort, Haynes said.</p>
<p>Highlighting economic opportunities, he said leveraging their investments in development through the private sector and engaging youth are areas that they are increasingly focused on.</p>
<p>“We are bringing business leaders and youth together to identify ways to equip young people with more marketable job-skills – creating a more talented workforce with the skills needed to drive companies towards greater success and help Bangladesh be more competitive in the global marketplace,” he said.</p>
<p>The US Embassy spokesperson said they continue to identify ways to strengthen the economic and trade ties between the two countries, while building on our work together to accelerate socio-economic development so that people in all corners of the country have equitable opportunities to live healthier and more prosperous lives.</p>
<p>“We are looking for ways in which we can collaborate with Bangladesh to modernize its military and be able to invest in maritime domain awareness to be able to understand what is on your coastal borders, what is coming in by air, land, and sea,"" he said.</p>
<p><strong>Issues around GSOMIA and ACSA</strong></p>
<p>Asked about the progress regarding the two proposed agreements - General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) and the Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), Haynes said GSOMIA is being considered between the US and Bangladesh armed forces as the two sides continue to explore opportunities for “more substantive and deeper” engagement.</p>
<p>The agreement is effectively a commitment that each side will effectively secure any information or sensitive materials received from the other, he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he said, ACSA facilitate the exchange of logistical support between partner militaries and enhance the opportunities for meaningful engagement.</p>
<p>Although there are no discussions at present between the US and Bangladesh about pursuing an ACSA, this could change in the future should the two sides determine it offers sufficient benefit, Haynes said.</p>
<p> </p>"";i:1;s:4595:""<p><strong>Myanmar Situation and Its Impacts</strong></p>
<p>“Obviously, we are very concerned, and we are following the developments in Burma [Myanmar] closely. The ongoing clashes in Burma [Myanmar] are deeply troubling. This is a significant concern not only for the region but also for the international community,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>He said the ongoing crisis in Myanmar is a pressing issue, and the United States has contributed more than two billion dollars in humanitarian assistance to this crisis, including approximately $500 million in Myanmar.</p>
<p>“It is essential to address the root causes of the crisis, promote stability, and work towards finding a sustainable and humane resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>They emphasised the need for diplomatic efforts and international cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the situation in Myanmar, aiming for a “comprehensive and inclusive” approach to ensure the well-being of the affected populations and regional stability.</p>
<p>“We also recognize the need to continue support for civilians displaced by the conflict in Burma, including both internally displaced people in Burma and Rohingya refugees residing in Bangladesh,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the United States provided an additional $87 million to continue providing food and nutrition assistance to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, which helped raise the monthly food rations for refugees to $10 per person per month.</p>
<p>“That was an important step to make sure they are getting enough food and nutrition to stay healthy. We also continue to provide support to Bangladeshi host communities through a range of multisectoral interventions, including job-skills and business literacy training to help people improve their livelihoods,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p><strong>A Positive Shift</strong></p>
<p>South Asia Institute Director at the Wilson Center and writer of Foreign Policy's weekly South Asia Brief Michael Kugelman has said US-Bangladesh relations have taken a more positive turn after a Bangladesh election that the US described as not free or fair.</p>
<p>He explained why, and also argued that this shift is not actually as sharp as it seems and noted that the visit came amid an apparent shift in bilateral relations, especially in terms of tone and messaging.</p>
<p>In the months ahead of Bangladesh’s Jan. 7 elections, the United States took strong steps to promote human rights and democracy, including through sanctions, visa restrictions, and public criticism.</p>
<p>Though that US State Department characterised the vote as not free or fair, US President Joe Biden sent a letter to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that welcomed the “next chapter” in the US-Bangladesh relationship; it did not mention rights or democracy.</p>
<p>During the U.S. delegation’s visit this week, Bangladeshi officials, including Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud, underscored the fresh start theme.</p>
<p>Salman F Rahman, an advisor to PM Hasina, said the “election is now a thing of the past.” Messaging from both sides was warm and effusive, with plenty of references to the partnership’s strength.</p>
<p>What accounts for the turnaround? Michael Kugelman said one possibility is Washington’s desire to distance itself from the highly charged political environment in Dhaka.</p>
<p>“The more U.S. officials publicly opine about human rights and democracy in Bangladesh, the more they risk getting dragged into it,” he wrote in Foreign Policy’s South Asia Brief.</p>
<p>He said strategic considerations are also likely at play and the previous US approach effectively gave Beijing and Moscow an advantage in Dhaka and rankled New Delhi.</p>
<p>“Geopolitical factors also play a role in the new US approach. The conflict in neighboring Myanmar is intensifying, and Bangladesh hosts hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees but seeks to repatriate them,” Kugelman said.</p>
<p>Washington wants to ensure that it has sufficient diplomatic space to engage with Dhaka on these sensitive issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kugelman said with US foreign-policy attention increasingly focused on instability in the Middle East, the United States wants to reduce diplomatic headaches elsewhere.</p>
<p>“The relationship’s tone and messaging are emphasizing positivity and potential, not public pressure. Ultimately, this reflects that, for now, the United States has concluded that smooth relations with Bangladesh are a strategic imperative,” he said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:2:{i:0;s:25:""news/details/4432665.webp"";i:1;s:25:""news/details/6120685.webp"";}s:8:""captions"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}}",2024-03-01 15:54:40,2024-03-01 16:01:35

<p>A series of workshops carried-out over three days ( 27- 29 February) that brought together judges and public prosecutors from the seven Divisions of Bangladesh including the most trafficking prone districts of the country.</p>
<p>The workshops focused on seeking an exchange of experiences, addressing common challenges and providing input from the learned participants on the Bench Book on Effective Adjudication of Human Trafficking Cases Using a Victim-centered Approach, jointly developed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).</p>
<p>The Bench Book is developed as part of the technical guidelines on the interpretation and full implementation of the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act (PSHTA) enacted in 2012; a landmark in Government of Bangladesh&rsquo;s commitment to combatting human trafficking in persons in the country.</p>
<p>This is a timey and critical initiative supported jointly under the a comprehensive counter trafficking programme to address human trafficking in Bangladesh funded by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) implemented by IOM, and the Global Action against Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants &ndash; Bangladesh (GLO.ACT &ndash; Bangladesh) project funded by the European Union and implemented by UNODC.</p>
<p>Speaking as the chief guest, Secretary of Law and Justice Division, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Golam Sarwar has said that the judiciary is a key player when it comes to the interpretation of the legislation ensuring victim friendly trial procedures and speedy disposal of human trafficking cases.</p>
<p>""Therefore, this Bench Book aims to serve as a legal resource guide on the adjudication of human trafficking cases in Bangladesh,"" he said.</p>
<p>AKM Tipu Sultan, Additional Secretary, Public Security Division, Ministry of Home Affairs, applauded the organizers and noted that &ldquo;the Bench Book marks a significant milestone in our journey towards achieving the shared goal of eradicating human trafficking. It is imperative that we continue to build upon the knowledge and insights gained through this endeavour&rdquo;.</p>
<p>F. Nusrath Ghazzali, Officer in Charge, IOM, reiterated that IOM has always stood steadfast to support the government&rsquo;s commitment to combat human trafficking, the Bench Book being one of several efforts towards this objective.</p>
<p>""Similar tools such as the manuals for law enforcement agencies and the Counter Trafficking Committees, are being finalized with the active participation of relevant government stakeholders&rdquo;.</p>
<p>""The Bench Book is one of our strongest tools that we have developed - we at UNODC are truly proud to have the opportunity to support you in your important work in combatting trafficking,"" said Jee Aei Lee, Legal and Policy Officer, UNODC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The development and implementation of the Bench Book represents a critical step in equipping the judiciary with the necessary tools and knowledge to effectively adjudicate human trafficking cases, ensuring the rights of victims,&rdquo; commented Hyunwoo Yang, Deputy Country Director, KOICA at the closing of the workshop.</p>
<p>The Bench Book on Effective Adjudication of Human Trafficking Cases Using a Victim-centered Approach will reflect the outcome of the discussions and suggestions discussed by the 49 (11 female, 38 male) judges and prosecutors during the workshop, andand the Bench Book will be submitted to the to the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs for finalization and dissemination amongst the relevant judges and public prosecutors.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;s:25:""news/details/9618785.webp"";}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-01 17:28:14,

<p>The event was held on the university&rsquo;s new green campus located in Merul Badda which features environmental sustainability on Thursday.</p>
<p>Highlighting the university's commitment to academic excellence, cultural enrichment, and environmental conservation, various aspects of BRAC University's dedication to environmental sustainability were showcased during the event. The university also shared its aspiration to lead in providing a comprehensive educational experience by engaging in environmentally friendly initiatives, showcasing local performances, and fostering discussions on pertinent issues.</p>
<p>In this &ldquo;Meet and Greet with Media&rdquo; event, Tamara Hasan Abed, Chairperson, Board of Trustees, BRAC University, along with other members of the Board of Trustees, Professor Syed Mahfuzul Aziz, Acting Vice-Chancellor, deans of schools, department chairpersons, and journalists from various media outlets were present.</p>
<p>Covering 7 acres of land in Merul Badda, this expansive BRAC University campus is the first environmentally friendly and sustainable advanced city campus in Bangladesh. Inspired by the ecosystem of the Sundarbans, the campus has been constructed to offer a blend of nature and architecture. The design, construction, and environmental aspects of this building involve experts from various countries, including Singapore, China, and Germany, contributing to its various unique features.</p>
<p>The building utilizes modern technologies such as cross-ventilation and hybrid thermal management systems, allowing light and air to enter from all sides. The use of Aerodynamic Fins ensures the optimal flow of air within the building.</p>
<p>The greenery, resembling a green carpet on the building's facade, provides oxygen, and the hybrid cooling system brings fresh air into the classrooms. As a result, even if students sit for long hours in class, fatigue will be minimized. These features contribute to reduced dependency on air conditioning, leading to the building's 40% energy self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Numerous rain chains have been installed to allow rainwater to reach trees and vegetation within the building and use the excess to replenish water bodies on the ground floor. The building also houses an advanced sewage treatment plant for waste management.</p>
<p>On the roof, there are solar panels generating 1.5 megawatts of electricity, providing 25% of the energy required for the building. The majority of the space in this modern and aesthetic building has been kept open for the students. In these open spaces, they can engage in mutual interactions and participate in various extracurricular activities. The campus is designed with universal accessibility so that students with special needs can easily access the campus and move around all areas comfortably.</p>
<p>Tamara Hasan Abed, Chairperson, Board of Trustees, BRAC University, shared the inspiring story behind the construction of the university's new eco-friendly campus and the educational philosophy of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. She said, ""Sir Fazle's vision was to establish a university where learning and pedagogy would flourish while coexisting with nature. The new campus is designed to combine nature and modern architecture to inspire future generations to think differently about life. While urbanization is an inevitable consequence of development, we must discover innovative solutions to safeguard nature. This new campus will serve as a benchmark for students and professionals in urban planning and environmental conservation.""</p>
<p>BRAC University's new campus is envisioned to serve as a laboratory for knowledge and science, as expressed by Professor Syed Mahfuzul Aziz, Acting Vice-Chancellor, BRAC University. He states, ""Essentially, we want to establish this new campus of BRAC University as a hub for knowledge and science. Our aspiration is to make this university a flagship institution in Bangladesh through ethical research and the provision of high-quality education. We are working towards that goal.""</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the event, the closing remarks were delivered by Salahdin Imam, a member of BRAC University's Board of Trustees and the Chair of the Campus Development Committee. The event was hosted by Khairul Basher, the Director of the Office of Communications, BRAC University.</p>

<p>Onika has studied under legendary painter Monirul Islam and volunteered at Studio Kala Kendra. A graduate of the Department of Printmaking at University of Development Alternative, she celebrates all that is home &mdash; habit, routine, tediousness, safety, sanctuary and also confinement.</p>

<p>It is a diary of the unremarkable and ordinariness of her existence and of the spaces that she inhabits. While Onika&rsquo;s perspective is self-referential, she is looking creatively and critically at the world through herself, according to AFD.</p>
<p>The objects are hard to make out, the perspectives are skewed, and there is a strange feeling of incomplete recognition. This must be how people see when come into the world, before dimension, definition, take shape and people begin to use cache memory instead of seeing.</p>
<p>The exhibition consists of works on paper, canvas as well as clay pots and wood. This cataloging of the everyday is graphic and lyrical, and while Onika has tried very hard to make the writing on her canvas escryptic (writing upside down and backwards in a tiny script), she comes across clear as day.</p>
<p>In her art there is a grand desire to find home and belonging in oneself, in others, and in familiar objects. And there is also an awareness that those everyday things are also quite strange, and if you look at them long enough, they lead to unfamiliar doorways and realities.</p>
<p>""These are conditions that grant us the peace to be. For we are not here forever, not for so long at all. And while we are here, it helps to feel at home, in our skin, in our rooms, in our world, so we can love it all, with our attention,"" the artist said.</p>

Last surviving member of the first team to conquer Mount Everest says it is crowded and dirty now,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Others/131831,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6363869.webp,World,Others,Last surviving member of the first team to conquer Mount Everest says it is crowded and dirty now,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3626:""<p>The only surviving member of the mountaineering expedition that first conquered Mount Everest said Saturday that the world's highest peak is too crowded and dirty, and the mountain is a god that needs to be respected.</p>
<p>Kanchha Sherpa, 91, was among the 35 members in the team that put New Zealander Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay atop the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) peak on May 29, 1953.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better for the mountain to reduce the number of climbers,&rdquo; Kanchha said in an interview in Kathmandu on Saturday, &ldquo;Right now there is always a big crowd of people at the summit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the first conquest, the peak has been climbed thousands of times, and it gets more crowded every year. During the spring climbing season in 2023, 667 climbers scaled the peak, but that brought in thousands of support staff to the base camp between the months of March and May.</p>
<p>There have been concerns about the number of people living on the mountain for months on end, generating trash and waste, but authorities have no plans to cut down on the number of permits they issue to climbers.</p>
<p>There are rules that require climbers to bring down their own trash, equipment and everything they carry to the mountain or risk losing their deposit, but monitoring has not been very effective.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/World/biden-approves-military-airdrops-of-aid-into-gaza-after-chaotic-encounter-left-more-than-100-dead/131819"">Biden approves military airdrops of aid into Gaza after chaotic encounter left more than 100 dead</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very dirty now. People throw tins and wrappings after eating food. Who is going to pick them up now?&rdquo; Kanchha said. &ldquo;Some climbers just dump their trash in the crevasse, which would be hidden at that time but eventually it will flow down to base camp as the snow melts and carries them downward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the Sherpas, Everest is Qomolangma or goddess mother of the world, and is revered by their community. They generally perform religious rituals before climbing the peak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should not be dirtying the mountain. It is our biggest god and they should not be dirtying the gods,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;Qomolangma is the biggest god for the Sherpas but people smoke and eat meat and throw them on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kanchha was just a young man when he joined the Hillary-Tenzing expedition. He was among the three Sherpas to go the last camp on Everest along with Hillary and Tenzing. They could not go any further because they did not have a permit.</p>

<p>They first heard of the successful ascent on the radio, and then were reunited with the summit duo at Camp 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all gathered at Camp 2 but there was no alcohol so we celebrated with tea and snacks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We then collected whatever we could and carried it to base camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The route they opened up from the base camp to the summit is still used by climbers. Only the section from the base camp to Camp 1 over the unstable Khumbu Icefall changes every year.</p>
<p>Kanchha has four children, eight grandchildren and a 20-month-old great-granddaughter. He lives with family in Namche village in the foothills of Mount Everest, where the family runs a small hotel catering to trekkers and climbers. &nbsp;</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-02 14:14:11,

<p>Zakat could be an ethics-based instrument to transform financial inclusion to financial empowerment of the poor, said eminent economist and former advisor to caretaker government Professor Dr. Hossain Zillur Rahman while speckling at the inaugural seminar ""CZM's Zakat-based Programs: A pioneering Innovation for Poverty Alleviation"".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Centre for Zakat Management (CZM) organised the event with the theme of 'Making a Difference with zakat'.</p>
<p>Hossain Zillur Rahman said that globally financial inclusion is a popular term in the economy. ""But zakat could play a major role in the case of financial empowerment of the poverty-stricken people"".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Urging the zakat management authority to be more cautious about the management cost, he said, zakat could serve more people if management cost could be lowered.</p>
<p>With Md Shahjahan Mia, Prof Emeritus of University of Southern Queensland of Australia, in the chair, the inaugural function was addressed among others by former chief election commissioner Justice Abdur Rouf, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank Abdul Awal Sarker, deputy managing director of Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) Dr Fazle Rabbi Sadek Ahmed, former secretary of the government Arastu Khan, and Islamic scholar Prof Mokhter Ahmed.</p>

<p>A number of leading business houses including Rahimafrooz, Khadim Ceramics, Kohinoor Chemicals, Rahim Steel, South Bridge, Hajj Finance Company Limited, are sponsoring the Zakat Fair to facilitate people to know the details of business zakat calculation methods including the accurate calculation of personal zakat.</p>
<p>Zakat Fair will remain open for all from 9 am to 7 pm. It will have stalls of various financial and zakat institutions including a zakat consultation desk, and stalls of various Islamic books.</p>
<p>Justice Abdur Rouf said that zakat was introduced in Islam so that wealth accumulation only in the hands of a few wealthy people could be prevented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chief executive officer of CZM Dr Mohammad Ayub Mia said the organisation has so far had 15 lakh people in the last 15 years and now 12,000 people are regularly getting food support from the organisation.</p>
<p>Abdul Awal Sarker said if zakat is properly collected, there would be a fund of Tk 80,000 crore annually which would be enough to utilise in alleviating the country's poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A total of six sessions will be held during this year's Zakat Fair.</p>
<p>A seminar on 'Importance of Zakat, Ushar and Waqf in Human Welfare' will be held for Khatibs and Imams at 11 am and a round table session on 'Role of Islamic Social Finance in Reducing Inequality' will be held in the afternoon on Sunday.</p>

She has taken robust policies and plans to protect Bangladesh from the adverse effects of climate change and global warming and create a pollution-free environment in the country. In 2011, she took the initiative to bring the conservation and development of environment and biodiversity as a constitutional obligation and adopted the long-term delta plan.</p>

"Many of those killed or wounded in Gaza stampede for aid were shot by Israel's army, EU arm says",AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Middle East/131868,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/8869950.webp,World,Middle East,"Many of those killed or wounded in Gaza stampede for aid were shot by Israel's army, EU arm says","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:6630:""<p>Many of the Palestinians killed or wounded in the chaos as they tried to get bags of flour from an aid convoy were hit by Israeli army fire, the European Union&rsquo;s diplomatic service said Saturday, urging an international investigation.</p>
<p>Outrage is rising over the desperation of hundreds of thousands struggling to survive in northern Gaza after nearly five months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. United States military planes began the first airdrops of thousands of meals into Gaza, and the militaries of Jordan and Egypt said they also conducted airdrops.</p>
<p>The European External Action Service said responsibility for the crisis lay with &ldquo;restrictions imposed by the Israeli army and obstructions by violent extremist(s) to the supply of humanitarian aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Residents in northern Gaza say they have taken to searching piles of rubble and garbage for anything to feed their children, who barely eat one meal a day. Many families have begun mixing animal and bird food with grain to bake bread. International aid officials say they have encountered catastrophic hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dying from starvation,&rdquo; said Soad Abu Hussein, a widow and mother of five children who has taken shelter in a school in the Jabaliya refugee camp.</p>
<p>At least 10 children have starved to death, according to hospital records in Gaza, the World Health Organization said.</p>
<p>Northern Gaza has borne the brunt of the conflict that began when the Hamas militant group launched an attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seizing around 250 hostages.</p>
<p>Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from the war has climbed to 30,320. The ministry doesn&rsquo;t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures, but says women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed.</p>
<p>In Gaza&rsquo;s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than half of the territory&rsquo;s people now seek refuge, an Israeli airstrike on Saturday struck tents outside the Emirati hospital, killing 11 people and wounding about 50, including health workers, Gaza&rsquo;s Health Ministry said.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s air, sea and ground offensive, reduced much of densely populated northern Gaza to rubble. The military told Palestinians to move south, but as many as 300,000 people are believed to have remained.</p>
<p>Roughly one in six children under the age of 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition and wasting, &ldquo;the worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world,&rdquo; Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the World Food Program, said this week. &ldquo;If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People have overwhelmed trucks delivering food aid to the region and grabbed what they can, Skau said, forcing the WFP to suspend aid deliveries to the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The breakdown in civil order, driven by sheer desperation, is preventing the safe distribution of aid,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In the violence Thursday, hundreds of people rushed about 30 trucks bringing a predawn delivery of aid to the north. Palestinians said nearby Israeli troops shot into the crowds. Israel said they fired warning shots toward the crowd and insisted many of the dead were trampled.</p>
<p>Doctors at hospitals in Gaza and a U.N. team that visited a hospital there said large numbers of the wounded had been shot.</p>
<p>Ahmed Abdel Karim, who was being treated at Kamal Adwan Hospital for gunshot wounds in his feet, said he had spent two days waiting for aid trucks to arrive before Thursday&rsquo;s convoy came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone attacked and advanced on these trucks. Because of the large number, I could not get flour,&rdquo; he said. He was shot by Israeli troops, he said.</p>
<p>Radwan Abdel-Hai, a father of four young children, heard a rumor late Wednesday that an aid convoy was on its way. He and five others took a donkey cart to meet it and found a &ldquo;sea of people&rdquo; waiting for the aid.</p>
<p>As people reached the trucks, &ldquo;tanks started firing at us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As I ran back, I heard tank shells and gunfire. I heard people screaming. I saw people falling to the ground, some motionless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abdel-Hai took shelter in a nearby building. When the shooting stopped, many dead people were on the ground, he said. &ldquo;Many were shot in their back,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Abu Hussein, the widow, said more than 5,000 people &mdash; mostly women and children &mdash; living with her in the Jabaliya school have not received any aid for more than four weeks. Adults eat one meal or less to save food for the children, she said.</p>
<p>A group of people went to the shore to try to fish, but three were killed and two were wounded by gunfire from Israeli ships, she said. &ldquo;They just wanted to get something for their children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Mansour Hamed, a 32-year-old former aid worker living with more than 50 relatives in a Gaza City house, said some are eating tree leaves and animal food. It has become normal to find a child coming out of the rubble with a rotten piece of bread, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are desperate. They want anything to stay alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acknowledging the difficulty of getting aid in and the extreme need for food, U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. would look for other ways to get shipments in, &ldquo;including possibly a marine corridor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jordan's military said its own airdrops targeted sites in northern Gaza and the drops it coordinated with the U.S. occurred in the south.</p>
<p>But the EU statement, echoing humanitarian groups including the International Rescue Committee and Medical Aid for Palestinians, said airdrops &ldquo;should be the solution of last resort as their impact is minimal and not devoid of risks to civilians.&rdquo; It called for the opening of further ground crossings into Gaza and the removal of obstacles from the rare ones open.</p>
<p>Aid workers hoped a possible cease-fire would help. A senior Egyptian official said cease-fire talks would resume Sunday in Cairo. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.</p>
<p>International mediators hope to reach agreement on a six-week pause in fighting, and an exchange of some Israeli hostages for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins around March 10.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-03 00:01:52,

<p>An AQI between 151 and 200 is considered 'unhealthy' while 201-300 is 'very unhealthy', and 301-400 is considered 'hazardous', posing severe health risks to residents.</p>

<p>The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them.</p>
<p>The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone.</p>
<p>Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon.</p>
<p>As per World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.</p>

Fishermen return to crab collection in Sundarbans after a 2-month ban,Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/2110111.webp,Environment,,Fishermen return to crab collection in Sundarbans after a 2-month ban,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:2890:""<p>Fishermen have resumed collecting crabs in the Sundarbans following the conclusion of a two-month government-enforced ban designed to safeguard the breeding season of crabs.</p>
<p>The ban, aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the crab population, ended last Thursday at midnight, with fishermen from coastal regions such as Mongla, Rampal, and Dakope seen entering the forest on Sunday with necessary equipment for crab collection.</p>
<p>The hiatus, necessitated by the breeding season of crabs in January and February, saw the issuance of pass-permits by the forest department halted. With the ban lifted, permits are once again being distributed, allowing the fishermen to legally collect crabs from the Sundarbans' extensive network of rivers and canals.</p>

<p>Spanning 6,017 sqkm in Bangladesh, including 1,874.1 sqkm of aquatic areas, the Sundarbans are home to 450 rivers and canals, along with 14 species of crabs.</p>
<p>To protect these species, certain canals have been designated as sanctuaries, with restrictions on crab collection in canals narrower than 25 feet enforced year-round.</p>
<p>Approximately 15,000 fishermen, equipped with valid forest department passes, depend on crab collecting within the non-restricted areas of the Sundarbans for their livelihood. The annual ban, instituted following the establishment of crab export guidelines, seeks to balance economic needs with environmental conservation.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Special/sundarbans-day-in-southwestern-region-on-feb-14-a-clarion-call-to-love-save-the-forest/130765"">Sundarbans Day in southwestern region on Feb 14; a clarion call to love, save the forest</a></p>
<p>Anisur Rahman, a crab collector from Joymoni in Mongla, highlighted the financial hardships faced by the fishermen due to the ban, pointing out the lack of governmental assistance during this period. Despite the ban's intent, there have been reports of illegal crab collection during the breeding season, undermining conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Mihir Kumar Doe, the forest Conservator of the Khulna region, confirmed that legal crab collection could resume in designated areas from March 2, with forest guards instructed to enhance patrolling to prevent illegal activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, strict guidelines have been put in place for the transportation of crabs, with divisional actions promised against violators.</p>
<p>This move to resume crab collection comes as a relief to many fishermen reliant on the trade, while the forest department remains vigilant against practices that could harm the Sundarbans' ecological balance.</p>

Clamp down on illegal hoarding of commodities during Ramadan: PM tells DCs,Farid Hossain,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/PMO/131882,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/3545614.webp,Bangladesh,PMO,Clamp down on illegal hoarding of commodities during Ramadan: PM tells DCs,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5602:""<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday asked the field-level administration to take stern action against illegal hoarders of commodities and ensure smooth supply of essential items to the consumers during the upcoming month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the Ramadan, some businesses are there who always want to make extra profit by hoarding the essentials and raising their prices. But we have to pay a special attention to it. It is now one of our immediate duties,&rdquo; said Sheikh Hasina.</p>
<p>The premier made the directives while opening the Deputy Commissioner&rsquo;s (DC) Conference-2024 at her office in the city.</p>
<p>Divisional Commissioners and deputy commissioners of districts joined the four-day conference, which will conclude on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the supply chain, problems are created or attempts are made to create artificial crisis of commodities. Some hoarders are there who let goods to be rotten but don&rsquo;t supply the goods to the market. It needs to take tough legal action in this regard,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The PM asked the field administration to pay a special attention so that the essential goods could reach to the common people smoothly during the upcoming Ramadan, the month of fasting for Muslims.</p>
<p>She said though the inflation rate is still within 10 percent in Bangladesh, it is nonetheless a problem.</p>
<p>She directed the officials to intensify monitoring on the market situation and ensure the consumers won&rsquo;t be subjected to harassment.</p>
<p>The prime minister asked the field administration to take action against food adulteration, boost the local production to reduce dependency on other countries, protect arable lands, raise public awareness for brining larger people under the universal pension scheme, promote formation of cooperatives for agricultural mechanisation to bring all lands under cultivation and maximise the return of cultivation, ensure smooth supply of produced goods to the market, to protect environment by saving everything like river, natural water reservoir and other water bodies, forest and hills.</p>

<p>She put emphasis on containing teenage gangs and addressing the reasons which lead them to engage in such anti-social activities, like snatching, robbery or killing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>She asked all including divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners and guardians to intensify their monitoring of educational institutes up to upazila and union-level so that the students can&rsquo;t be engaged in militancy, terrorism, drugs or teenage gangs.</p>
<p>The premier asked the field administration to raise the engagement of students through the arrangement of a larger number of sports competitions and cultural competitions in a bid to keep them away from different social diseases like drug, terrorism and militancy.</p>
<p>Noting that waste management has emerged as a big problem in Bangladesh, Hasina said this problem has turned acute everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, if we take plans in advance&nbsp;now&nbsp;for waste management in district, upazila and up to even union and ward level, the problem will not be seen in future,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The PM asked the commissioners to undertake a development project after considering what would be its return and how much it can benefit the common people and the country, and how much the socio-economic condition of the locals would be improved. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this regard she asked the deputy commissioners to monitor the projects being implemented in their workplace.</p>
<p>Mentioning that lands are taken for a project from deputy commissioners or commissioners, she said, &ldquo;If you give the lands and do others (for a project), why can&rsquo;t you monitor it. Since you give lands, you have the right to watch the projects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The government will take reports from the DC about the condition, progress and return of the projects and negative impacts on arable lands. &nbsp;&ldquo;You will have to be accountable,&rdquo; said Sheikh Hasina.</p>
<p>She thanked the deputy commissioners for doing the election duty successfully following the directives of the Election Commission during the 12th parliamentary elections held on January 7, 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time the election has been the most free, fair and neutral polls,&rdquo; said Hasina.</p>
<p>The prime minister asked the deputy commissioners to implement the promises announced in her party&rsquo;s election manifesto and make development of the country, focusing on employment generation.</p>
<p>The subsequent programmes of the conference will be held at Osmani Memorial Auditorium, featuring a total of 30 sessions.</p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary Mahbub Hossain delivered the welcome speech.</p>
<p>Public Administration Minister Farhad Hossain, PM&rsquo;s Principal Secretary Tofazzel Hossain Miah, Dhaka divisional commissioner Sabirul Islam, Chattogram DC Abul Bashar Mohammed Fakhruzzaman and Gaibandha DC Kazi Nahid Rasul spoke at the opening session.</p>

<p>Hosted by the Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio & Communication (BNNRC), the event took place from March 2-3 at the Savar CCDB Hope Center. It was meticulously designed to refine the reporting capabilities of journalists, emphasizing the importance of the Safe System Approach to road safety.</p>
<p>The workshop aimed at arming journalists from various media landscapes—including daily newspapers, both public and private TV channels, online news portals, and news agencies—with the essential knowledge and tools to effectively cover road safety issues.</p>
<p>The curriculum was rich and varied, covering a broad spectrum of topics. These ranged from global road safety perspectives to the local context, including the Safe Road Safety Approach, comprehensive road safety laws, risk factors, crash reporting, fact-checking, and verification tools. It also touched on constructive interview techniques, the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to road safety, and a detailed overview of road safety challenges in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>In the workshop's opening remarks, AHM Bazlur Rahman of BNNRC, Taifur Rahman of GRSP, Dr. Shariful Alam, and Mervyn Christian of GHAI underscored the training's significance. They emphasized how vital it is for journalists to report on road safety through an evidence-based lens, highlighting the training's role in fostering a more informed and proactive media landscape in addressing road safety issues.</p>
<p>The closing session saw AHM Bazlur Rahman, Taifur Rahman, and Dr. Shariful Alam expressing their gratitude and optimism. They articulated their hope that the training would lead to a tangible improvement in the quality of road safety journalism, enabling reporters to delve deeper into issues surrounding the Safe System Approach and comprehensive road safety laws and policies.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;s:25:""news/details/5225759.webp"";}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-03 15:42:42,2024-03-03 15:45:19
LPG price hiked: Consumers to see increment from today,Karim Waheed,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Others/131893,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/8694459.webp,Bangladesh,Others,LPG price hiked: Consumers to see increment from today,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:1931:""<p>In an update from the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) has been adjusted upwards by Tk 0.66, setting the new rate at Tk 123.52 per kg, up from the previous Tk 122.86. This price change is effective from 6 pm on Sunday (March 03, 2024), indicating a slight increase in household and commercial expenses.</p>
<p>BERC, at a press briefing today, detailed the adjustment, noting that the price for a standard 12 kg LPG cylinder will now be Tk 1482, inclusive of VAT, marking an increase from the previous Tk 1474. This adjustment follows a rational scale across various LPG cylinder sizes, ranging from 5.5 kg to 45 kg, addressing the need for a proportional price revision across different consumer segments.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the price for &ldquo;auto gas,&rdquo; the LPG variant used in motor vehicles, has also seen a revision, now priced at Tk 68.05 per litre, including VAT, a slight increase from Tk 67.68. This adjustment reflects the broader impact of LPG price changes on transportation and related costs.</p>
<p>Notably, LPG prices marketed by the state-owned LP Gas Company will remain unchanged. This exception is attributed to its local production and the company&rsquo;s minimal market share, which is less than 5 percent.</p>
<p>The decision to adjust LPG prices comes in the wake of rising costs in the international market, specifically tied to the increase in the Saudi CP (contract price), which serves as a benchmark for local operators importing LPG primarily from the Middle East.</p>

<p>The BNP leader said Quader claimed that hundred percent people of the country are getting electricity supply while his PM a few days ago stated that load-shedding in small scale should remain in the country.</p>
<p>He said people of the country are suffering from load-shedding morning to evening whereas the temperature still remains at tolerable level.</p>

<p>Rizvi denounced Quader’s another statement that BNP is pleading with its foreign master by ignoring the people of the country.</p>
<p>He alleged that the AL general secretary is perhaps suffering from amnesia as he had forgotten the 2014 election when India’s then-foreign minister Sujata Singh visited Bangladesh to show their support to AL and manage HM Ershad to join the polls.</p>
<p>It is a clear sign of intervention in a sovereign country, he added.</p>
<p>This time also (January 7 election) the people of the country have seen that they (India) stand beside AL not Bangladeshi people, he continued.</p>
<p>Rizvi said they can do anything here as AL recognizes them as their master by showing a ‘knee-jerk’ attitude.</p>

<p>The press conference was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China.</p>
<p>Thousands of Chinese political elites and lawmakers started gathering in Beijing to kick off China’s annual legislative meetings, the “Two Sessions” or “lianghui"" which traditionally offer a preview of the Chinese government’s policy agenda for the year.</p>
<p>It will start with the annual meeting of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference on March 4 and be followed by the annual legislative session of China’s parliament on March 5, during which Chinese Prime minister Li Qiang will deliver his first government work report.</p>
<p>Earlier on February 29, the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee met to discuss the draft government work report, which the State Council will submit at the second session of the 14th National People’s Congress for deliberation where Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>It was noted at the meeting that in the past year, in the face of an exceptionally complicated international environment and the arduous tasks of promoting reform, pursuing development, and maintaining stability, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, brought together the entire Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and led them in withstanding external pressure, overcoming internal difficulties and making strenuous efforts. </p>
<p>As a result, the country achieved a smooth transition in its COVID response, its economy rebounded for the better, and the people’s well-being was effectively ensured. The country successfully delivered the main goals and tasks for its economic and social development during the year, made tangible progress in high-quality development, and took solid strides in building itself into a modern socialist country in all respects.</p>
<p>The year of 2024 also marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the founding of the CPPCC.</p>
<p>Second session of the 14th of the National People's Congress ( NPC) will open on March 5 while the second session of the 14th CPPCC will open on March 4. </p>
<p>NPC is the highest organ of State power and China's top legislative body while its permanent body is the Standing Committee. Each congress is elected for a 5-year term.</p>
<p>It deliberates and passes major laws, decides on major issues, and supervises the work of the State Council, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate.</p>
<p>There are nearly 3,000 NPC deputies, among which females account for nearly a quarter. Every ethnic group has its NPC deputy or deputies. NPC deputies submit motions and are the voice of the people they represent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, CPPCC is China's top political advisory body which is considered as an important institution of multiparty co-operation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China. It is elected for a 5-year term. </p>
<p>It has more than 2000 members including Communist Party of China (CPC) representatives, members of other political parties, and all walks of life.</p>

<p>The launching event of Bancassurance (insurance through the banking system) was held in a city hotel on Sunday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Naser Ezaz Bijoy, Chief Executive Officer, SCB said that this partnership will enable Standard Chartered&rsquo;s clients to access a wide range of insurance products and services through the bank's extensive network of branches and digital channels.</p>
<p>As the first international bank SCB to launch Bancassurance in Bangladesh, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been advocating for Bancassurance since I took on the role of CEO Bangladesh &ndash; because, locally, life and non-life insurance has a 0.41 percent penetration to gross domestic product (GDP). This rate highlights immense potential for growth and development,&rdquo; he pointed out.</p>
<p>Through Bancassurance, trained and certified colleagues of SCB will bring a one-stop financial service to the trusted clients and customers, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High uptake of Bancassurance will result in risk diversification, lower premiums, capital market development, and overall GDP growth. With the insurance sector poised to double in size by 2031 across the world, we are proud to partner with MetLife to implement Bancassurance in Bangladesh,&rdquo; said the CEO of SCB.</p>
<p>Ala Ahmad, Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Bangladesh, said, &ldquo;Our Bancassurance partnership with Standard Chartered reflects our long-term dedication to responsibly meeting the evolving needs of customers and strengthening their trust in insurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is confident that Bancassurance will emerge as an effective approach to financial security because it empowers Bank&rsquo;s customers to manage their life priorities with MetLife&rsquo;s trusted insurance solutions.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered and MetLife are two leading global financial institutions with a long history of serving customers in Bangladesh. Standard Chartered is the oldest bank in the country, with over 119 years of presence, while MetLife is the leading life insurer in Bangladesh.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-03 20:25:47,
Fuel price may decline with application of automated pricing guideline: Nasrul Hamid,Shayan S Khan,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Local Business/131919,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/3635496.webp,Business,Local Business,Fuel price may decline with application of automated pricing guideline: Nasrul Hamid,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3433:""<p>State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid has indicated that the price of petroleum fuel may witness a decline with the application of the government-announced guideline for introducing their automated prices.</p>
<p>""We&rsquo;re waiting for the approval of the Prime Minister for the guideline... If we can apply the guideline within the first week of March, we&rsquo;ll hopefully see a decline in the price,&rdquo; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The government on Friday issued a &ldquo;Fuel Pricing Guidelines&rdquo; through a gazette notification to set an automated price for the petroleum fuels across the country. It said the system will be effective from March.</p>
<p>Under the guidelines, prices of all the petroleum fuels including petrol, diesel, octane, kerosene, furnace oil, jet fuel, marine fuels will be set automatically on the basis of the international market price.</p>
<p>Nasrul Hamid said the government&rsquo;s main priority is the adjustment in the price of the diesel as the most consumption comes from this petroleum product.</p>
<p>He noted that from now on every month there will be adjustment in fuel prices. &ldquo;If we seek, the price declines in the global market, local consumers will benefit from it. Now the prices of fuel are at an economic level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also said the local prices will go up and down in line with the international price and every month such prices will be announced by the government for one-month tenure.</p>
<p>Immediately after issuing the guideline on Friday, Energy Secretary Md Nurul Alam had said that it won't be effective from today (from March). &ldquo;Since we have not yet received the Prime Minister&rsquo;s approval to make the guideline effective, we&rsquo;ve to wait for some more days,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope we'll get the PM&rsquo;s approval soon and will bring it into effect within 10-12 days,&rdquo; he told UNB.</p>
<p>The Fuel Pricing Guidelines, however, giving an example for its effectiveness said that if it is planned to make effective from April 1, the prices of fuels of one month in the international market from February 21 to March 20 has to be taken into consideration to set an average price and then set the price for month of April.</p>
<p>About such contradictory instructions in the guideline, the energy secretary said that such an automated pricing system is a new thing in Bangladesh. So, the ministry itself is in some confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sit with the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) to remove all confusions and make the guideline clear to all,&rdquo; he said. The BPC is the state agency for importing and marketing of petroleum products across the country.</p>
<p>In case of setting a price for any of the petroleum fuels, all the expenses including the international market price, import tax, advance income tax and valued added tax (VAT), operational expense, finance, administrative and maintenance cost, margins of BPC, VAT, and sale and distribution costs will be taken into account and then set a price.</p>
<p>A source in the Energy Division said that the price of octane will go below the price of diesel as soon as the automated pricing formula is effective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is also a big concern for the government&rdquo;, he said, adding that the government wants to keep the octane price higher than diesel,&rdquo; he added.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-03 20:28:55,

<p>These findings were unveiled during the ""Knowledge, Power, and Change in Polycrisis: Lessons from Bangladesh for the World"" conference, jointly organized by CLEAR, BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), Brac University, and the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), University of Sussex.</p>
<p>In the opening ceremony of the conference, speakers spoke of the challenges, particularly the worsened socioeconomic inequalities, and also stressed on the lessons that can be learned from Bangladesh’s experience in living through a polycrisis such as the pandemic, reads a press release.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor and Acting Vice-Chancellor of Brac University, Professor Syed Mahfuzul Aziz, recognized Bangladesh’s relative success in managing mortality during the pandemic while acknowledging socioeconomic challenges such as poverty and the digital divide.</p>
<p>“I believe that allocating resources to better prepare us for future crises could actually be instrumental in more effectively tackling their negative effects. This is where research as the ones conducted by CLEAR are so important. Lessons from this conference will show how knowledge and evidence from the local community can enrich the global community,” he said. </p>
<p>Dr. Sohela Nazneen, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies and Research Lead for the CLEAR, highlighted the programme's collaborative nature and its key objectives.</p>
<p>""Crises push the boundaries of what we know and what we can learn. CLEAR was established as a co-constructed and co-developed program. This approach underscores our commitment to inclusive research and knowledge generation,” she said.</p>
<p>While emphasizing the urgency of learning from crises, Dr. Imran Matin, Executive Director, BIGD stressed upon the immediate value of research at critical junctures, explaining that research needs to look into a crisis’ socioeconomic and sociopolitical impacts on communities and highlighted the importance of translating knowledge into action.</p>
<p>“Knowledge matters if we actually take the power dimension into the knowledge perspective,” he added.</p>
<p>The CLEAR programme study also found that households resorted to various coping mechanisms to mitigate the economic impact. Prolonged school closures exacerbated educational challenges, and uneven access to social protection and the psychosocial toll of poverty that pose additional barriers to recovery efforts.</p>

<p>The findings of this study were officially unveiled at the BGMEA headquarters in Dhaka on March 3.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by Wazir Advisors, an international consulting firm focused on sectors of textile, apparel, and retail. The comprehensive report signifies a paradigm shift in the industry's approach, recognizing the untapped potential and opportunities within the non-cotton textile and apparel value chain.</p>
<p>The report provides actionable recommendations, meticulously outlining a roadmap for the industry to navigate the complexities of diversification, presenting concrete steps for stakeholders to enhance their competitiveness on the global stage.</p>
<p>Faruque Hassan, President, BGMEA commented on the report stating &ldquo;The findings and recommendation of this study are very important for our industry. It provides a roadmap for us to not only adapt to the evolving global market but to thrive in it. BGMEA is committed to fostering diversification and supporting exponential growth in the Bangladesh apparel industry. This report opens up new horizons for Bangladesh, and we are excited to embrace the opportunities it presents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given the changing dynamics of the global fashion landscape, there is a notable shift towards fibres other than cotton. These fibres are not only synthetics (such as polyester &amp; nylon); but also regenerated fibres (such as Viscose rayon), animal fibres (wool &amp; silk) and even other vegetable fibres (such as linen).</p>
<p>While the demand for cotton products is still large, from a diversification perspective, non-cotton fibre products offer an important opportunity, said BGMEA.</p>
<p>By aligning with these evolving trends, Bangladesh can not only meet the changing demands of consumers but also position itself as a key player in the contemporary fashion industry.</p>
<p>The project lead from Wazir Advisors, Varun Vaid observed, &ldquo;Addition of non-cotton products in Bangladesh&rsquo;s export basket can enhance the total addressable market for the country. Bangladesh has already proved its mettle in the global apparel trade by emerging as the second largest exporting nation. With development of complete supply chain of non-cotton products, Bangladesh can aim to maintain its high growth trajectory&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This study covers facts and figures about the changing fibre mix in the global context, emerging trends that will impact industry in future, an in-depth analysis of Bangladesh&rsquo;s current value chain structure based on feedback of buyers, manufacturers &amp; policy makers, comparison of Bangladesh with other leading non-cotton players such as China, Indian &amp; Taiwan.</p>
<p>It sets the vision for Bangladesh&rsquo;s non-cotton sector and the roadmap to achieve it.</p>
<p>The study will serve as a guiding compass, steering the Bangladesh apparel industry towards a future that embraces innovation, versatility, and sustained competitiveness in the ever-evolving global market.</p>

China and Myanmar likely to be high on the agenda when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Australia,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Asia/131936,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/9170985.webp,World,Asia,China and Myanmar likely to be high on the agenda when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Australia,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:4508:""<p>An increasingly assertive China and a humanitarian crisis in Myanmar are likely to be high on the agenda when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Australia for a rare summit this week.</p>
<p>The ASEAN-Australia Special Summit that starts in Melbourne on Monday marks 50 years since Australia became the first official partner of the Asian bloc.</p>
<p>Leaders of nine of the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations are expected to attend the three-day summit, with Myanmar excluded from political representation over its failure to stem violence in that country since a military junta seized control in 2021. East Timor&rsquo;s leader has been invited as an official ASEAN observer and Australian Prime Anthony Albanese invited his New Zealand counterpart to Melbourne to meet regional leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Australia sees ASEAN at the center of a stable, peaceful and prosperous region,&rdquo; Albanese said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strengthening our relationship ensures our shared future prosperity and security,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Australia has hosted ASEAN leaders once before in Sydney in 2018. The leaders issued a statement with the host country then that called for a code of conduct covering the contested waters of the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly assertive over its competing territorial claims with a number of ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>Australia and the Philippines, an ASEAN member, conducted joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea for the first time in November last year.</p>
<p>Also in November, Australia proposed to ASEAN members that they declare in a joint statement at the end of the Melbourne summit their support for the 2016 arbitration ruling in The Hague in favor of the Philippines that invalidated Beijing&rsquo;s vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, Australian Broadcasting Corp said in December. China has rejected that ruling.</p>
<p>Other ASEAN countries with territorial claims in conflict with China are Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>China's increasingly assertive posture in the South China Sea and violence in Myanmar topped a meeting of ASEAN diplomats in January in Laos, the group's poorest nation, which has taken over the bloc's rotating leadership this year.</p>
<p>International Crisis Group's Asia program deputy director Huong Le Thu, who is attending the summit in Australia, said ASEAN has always been divided over how to approach China, with each member nation maintaining a unique bilateral relationship with the economic giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the commonality of one approach being feasible. They are working out the best way to manage this power asymmetry that they have with China,&rdquo; Le Thu said.</p>
<p>The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar that hangs over the summit challenges ASEAN&rsquo;s credibility as an organization, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It poses the question for its existence in the first place: why the countries&rsquo; governments in the region get together and what is the purpose of this intergovernmental institution if it cannot act on the internal crisis that effects its own organization and the region?&rdquo; Le Thu said.</p>
<p>Around 200 protesters, mostly from the Myanmar diaspora, demonstrated outside the summit on Monday morning demanding the restoration of democracy in Myanmar and that ASEAN not engage with the country&rsquo;s military leaders.</p>
<p>Australia, as the summit host, is focused on maritime cooperation, economic ties, climate change and clean energy.</p>
<p>Melissa Conley Tyler, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy and Defense Dialogue think tank, expects leaders will focus on what they share in common rather than their differences on issues such as China and Myanmar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The focus is very much going to be on how do Australia and the ASEAN countries work together to create a region where we want to live?&rdquo; said Conley Tyler, who is attending the summit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myanmar is a continuing issue, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;ll be a focus. I feel the focus will be all positive, very future-oriented, talking about what we can do together and building that sense of excitement and momentum,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>ASEAN members include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and they have a combined population of more than 650 million and GDP of more than $3 trillion.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-03-04 08:34:13,
