Capital One to buy Discover for $35 billion in deal that combines major US credit card companies,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Others/131259,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/8531850.webp,World,Others,Capital One to buy Discover for $35 billion in deal that combines major US credit card companies,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5484:""<p>Capital One Financial said it will buy Discover Financial Services for $35 billion, in a deal that would bring together two of the nation's credit card companies as well as potentially shake up the payments industry, which is largely dominated by Visa and Mastercard.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the all-stock transaction, Discover Financial shareholders will receive Capital One shares valued at nearly $140. That's a significant premium to the $110.49 that Discover shares closed at Friday.</p>
<p>The deal marries two of the largest credit card companies that aren't banks first, like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, with the notable exception of American Express. It also brings together two companies whose customers are largely similar: often Americans who are looking for cash back or modest travel rewards, compared to the premium credit cards dominated by AmEx, Citi and Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This marketplace that&rsquo;s dominated by the big players is going to shrink a little bit more now,&rdquo; said Matt Schulz, chief credit card analyst at LendingTree.</p>
<p>It also will give Discover's payment network a major credit card partner in a way that could make the payment network a major competitor once again. The U.S. credit card industry is dominated by the Visa-Mastercard duopoly with AmEx being a distance third place and Discover an even more distant fourth place.</p>

<p>With its purchase of Discover, Capital One is betting that Americans&rsquo; will continue to increasingly use their credit cards and keep balances on those accounts to collect interest. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Americans held $1.13 trillion on their credit cards, and aggregate household debt balances increased by $212 billion, up 1.2%, according to the latest data from the New York Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>As they run up their card balances, consumers are also paying higher interest rates. The average interest rate on a bank credit card is roughly 21.5%, the highest it&rsquo;s been since the Federal Reserve started tracking the data in 1994.</p>
<p>At the same time, the two lenders have had to boost their reserves against the possibility of rising borrower defaults. After battling inflation for more than two years, many lower- and middle-income Americans have run through their savings and are increasingly running up their credit card balances and taking on personal loans.</p>
<p>The additional reserves have weighed on both banks&rsquo; profits. Last year, Capital One&rsquo;s net income available to common shareholders slumped 35% versus 2022, as its provisions for loan losses soared 78% to $10.4 billion. Discover&rsquo;s full-year profit sank 33.6% versus its 2022 results as its provisions for credit losses more than doubled to $6.02 billion.</p>
<p>Discover&rsquo;s customers are carrying $102 billion in balances on their credit cards, up 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the charge-off rates and 30-day delinquency rates have climbed.</p>
<p>Beyond boosting bank deposits and loan accounts, the acquisition would give Capital One access to the Discover payment processing network. While smaller than industry giants Visa and Mastercard, the Discover network will enable Capital One to get revenue from fees charged for every merchant transaction that runs on the network.</p>

<p>Discover has been operating under heightened scrutiny from regulators. Last summer, the company disclosed that beginning around mid-2007, it incorrectly classified certain card accounts into its highest merchant pricing tiers. The company also received an unrelated consent order from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over its customer compliance management.</p>
<p>Analysts at Citigroup say the regulatory issues may have prompted the sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are surprised that DFS would sell, but suppose that its regulatory challenges such as its recent October FDIC consent order and the card product misclassification issue may have opened the door for the board to consider strategic alternatives that it may not have in the past,&rdquo; wrote analysts Arren Cyganovich and Kaili Wang in a note to clients.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether the deal will pass regulatory scrutiny. Nearly every bank issues a credit card to customers but few companies are credit card companies first, and banks second. Both Discover &mdash; which was long ago the Sears Card &mdash; and Capital One started off as credit card companies that expanded into other financial offerings like checking and savings accounts.</p>
<p>Consumer groups are expected to put heavy pressure on the Biden Administration to make sure the deal is good for consumers as well as shareholders.</p>

<p>This exam center, hosting 777 candidates from 10 different institutions for the Dakhil exam, became the focal point of an operation carried out between 11:30 am and 12 pm. The operation was sparked by a tip-off about the presence of fake examinees attempting the Arabic-I paper, which commenced at 10 am.</p>

Their collaborative effort led to the detention of 59 individuals for attempting to take the exam under false pretenses.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to thoroughly verify the admit cards, photographs, and other pertinent documents of all examinees to ascertain the total number of impersonators.

<p>Ziaul received Ekushey Padak-2024 for social service as he dedicated his entire life to creating a public library and free book distribution among insolvent students with the little bit of profit he made from selling yoghurt.</p>
<p>Despite being a brilliant student, he had to struggle in life due to financial insolvency instead of going to school. The great man started shouldering the responsibility of poor students and distribution of free books among insolvent students, creating a family library first (in 1969) and then a public library titled &ldquo;Ziaul Haque Common Library.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hasina, also the eldest daughter of Bangabandhu, said she would arrange a permanent land and building for the public library developed by Ziaul as he demanded while receiving the Ekushey Padak.</p>
<p>Besides, she said the government would take a move to nationalize the school established by him, if he wants.</p>
<p>Referring to the history of Bangladesh, the PM said her government has successfully freed the nation from distortion of history after coming power to 1996.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that we&rsquo;ve at least been able to free the people from the distorted history after Awami League came to power in 1996. Today the people have known the real history of the Language Movement and the Liberation War,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Talking about the role of Bangabandhu in the Language Movement, Sheikh Hasina said unfortunately there was an attempt to erase the contribution of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to the Language Movement from the history.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to expand the offensive to the Gaza Strip's southernmost city of Rafah, where more than half of the territory's population of 2.3 million has sought refuge from fighting elsewhere. Many have crowded into sprawling tent camps and overflowing U.N.-run shelters near the Egyptian border.</p>

<p>The United States, Israel&rsquo;s top ally, has been working with mediators Egypt and Qatar to try to broker another cease-fire and hostage release agreement. Hamas&rsquo; top political leader Ismail Haniyeh was in Cairo to meet with Egyptian officials on Tuesday, but there was no expectation of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The Israeli military meanwhile ordered the evacuation of the Zaytoun and Turkoman neighborhoods on the southern edge of Gaza City, an indication that Palestinian militants are still putting up stiff resistance in areas of northern Gaza that the Israeli military said had been largely cleared weeks ago.</p>
<p>Residents said there have been airstrikes and heavy ground fighting in eastern parts of Gaza City over the past two days. &ldquo;The situation is very difficult,"" said Ayman Abu Awad, who lives in Zaytoun. ""We are trapped inside our homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A POTENTIAL &lsquo;EXPLOSION&rsquo; OF PREVENTABLE CHILD DEATHS<br />The report by the Global Nutrition Cluster, an aid partnership led by UNICEF, says more than 90% of children under 5 in Gaza eat two or fewer food groups a day, known as severe food poverty. A similar percentage are affected by infectious diseases, with 70% experiencing diarrhea in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>More than 80% of homes lack clean and safe water, with the average household having one liter (quart) per person per day, according to the report released Monday.</p>
<p>In Gaza&rsquo;s southernmost city of Rafah, where most humanitarian aid enters, the acute malnutrition rate is 5%, compared to 15% in northern Gaza, which has been isolated by the Israeli military and largely cut off from aid for months. Before the war the rate across Gaza was less than 1%, the report said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gaza Strip is poised to witness an explosion in preventable child deaths, which would compound the already unbearable level of child deaths in Gaza,&rdquo; UNICEF official Ted Chaiban said in a statement.</p>
<p>A U.N. report in December found that Gaza&rsquo;s entire population of 2.3 million Palestinians is in a food crisis, with a quarter of the population facing starvation.</p>

<p>Israel says it does not restrict the import of humanitarian supplies, but aid groups say delivery within Gaza has been severely hampered by Israeli road closures, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order as Israeli strikes have targeted the Hamas-run police force.</p>
<p>The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main provider of aid in Gaza, said earlier this month that Israel was holding up a food shipment that could feed over a million people. Israel accused 12 employees of the agency of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack, without providing evidence. That led the United States and other major donors to freeze vital funding for the agency, even after it fired the workers and launched an independent investigation.</p>
<p>NO END IN SIGHT TO MONTHSLONG WAR<br />The war began when Hamas-led militants burst through Israel's formidable border defenses and rampaged across communities in southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. The militants are still holding some 130 captives, around a fourth of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released in a prisoner-hostage exchange last year.</p>
<p>Israel responded to the attack with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history in the tiny coastal enclave, which has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.</p>
<p>Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian death toll had risen to 29,092 since the start of the war, with around two-thirds of the fatalities being women and children. More than 69,000 Palestinians have been wounded, overwhelming the territory&rsquo;s hospitals, less than half of which are even partially functioning. The ministry does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties in its count.</p>
<p>Israel says it has killed over 10,000 Palestinian militants but has provided no evidence for its count. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because the militant group fights in dense residential neighborhoods. The military says 237 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the ground offensive in late October.&nbsp;</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-20 16:36:03,

<p>This announcement was made by State Minister for Commerce, Ahasanul Islam Titu, following a crucial meeting with the 'Task Force on Review of Commodity Prices and Market Situation' at his ministry's Secretariat office.</p>

<p>As of now, the retail price of bottled soybean oil stands at Tk 173 per litre. With the upcoming adjustment, the price will drop to Tk 163. Additionally, the cost for open (loose) soybean oil will decrease to Tk 149, and a 5-litre can will be available for Tk 800.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the state minister indicated that the prices for palm oil would remain steady for the time being.</p>
<p>Titu shared insights into the government's expectations from the business sector, stating, &ldquo;The Prime Minister expects that large-scale industries and businessmen will uphold their social responsibilities. Taking all factors into account, we approached them, and they have agreed to reduce the edible oil price by Tk 10 per litre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This price adjustment follows the government's tax reduction circular issued on February 8, which aims to streamline the import process and availability of essential goods like soybean oil. ""It usually takes about a month for an import shipment to arrive and another two months for clearance and distribution to the consumer level,"" explained Titu.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On 18th February, the LGRD minister told parliament that each Member of Parliament (MP) could receive Tk 20 crore over five years for implementing development projects in their respective constituencies.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The process of finalizing a project in this regard is currently underway.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">TIB Executive Director (ED) Dr. Iftekharuzzaman said, &ldquo;Despite the gradual increase in constituency-wise block allocations, there has been historical negligence in ensuring proper fund utilization and governance in these projects. Lawmakers, who have sole authority over monitoring and addressing complaints related to the projects, often endorse irregularities for personal gain, leading to compromised transparency and accountability.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;He highlighted that such schemes provide opportunities to many parliamentarians to abuse political power, engage in nepotism, and gain unethical financial benefits, ultimately normalizing corruption at the local level and misusing state resources.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">TIB's concerns stem from its previous study titled ""Governance Challenges in the Implementation of the Infrastructure Development Project under Constituency-Based Block Allocation"", published on 12 August 2020.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The study uncovered that the schemes under the projects were deemed essential at local level, but their quality of work did not meet expectation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This discrepancy was attributed to compromised relationships fostering mutual benefit and commission trading between the contractors and their supervisory authorities involved in planning and execution of the schemes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Consequently, irregularities and corruption within the schemes led to squandering of public funds, ultimately benefiting vested quarters, it said..</p>

<p>Dhaka, Feb 20 (UNB) &ndash; BNP leader Jamiruddin Sircar on Tuesday stressed the need for his party to carry out a grassroots campaign to reach out to common people across the country as a means to restore democracy.</p>
<p>Speaking at a discussion meeting, he also expressed high hope that people will turn around to establish their rights as the Language Movement of 1952 teaches people not to bow their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to now go door to door of the people and say together, BNP means peace, democracy, and the development of common people. Inshallah, democracy will return to the country,"" the BNP leader said.</p>
<p>Sircar, a BNP standing committee member and a former speaker of the national parliament, said the country is destined to descend into chaos due to the absence of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p>He said the BNP and the leaders and workers of the party have long been going through a tough time since they have working to establish democracy and people&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>BNP arranged the programme at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh, marking Shaheed Day and International Mother Language Day which will be observed across the country on Wednesday with due respect.</p>
<p>Sircar said the Language Movement was not a traditional movement as it was an ideological movement.</p>
<p>He said the Language Movement was a democratic movement in protest against Pakistanis' efforts to impose Urdu as the state language instead of Bengali.</p>
<p>""The Language Movement led to the attainment of Bangladesh's independence. This Language Movement teaches us that we will realise our rights...we won&rsquo;t bow down. We must be allowed to raise our voice and our rights must be ensured,&rdquo; the BNP leader said.</p>
<p>Another BNP standing committee member Gayeshwar Chandra Roy said Bangali is the only nation who has sacrificed lives, shed blood, and fought for their mother language. &ldquo;Sacrificing lives for the mother language Bangla was the best example in the past century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said Pakistanis gave Bangalis a Shaheed Minar by brutally killing those who launched the Language Movement on February 21, 1952. &ldquo;But it has now become a situation of creating Shaheed Minar in every house in Bangladesh thanks to Sheikh Hasina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The BNP leader alleged that their party&rsquo;s several thousand leaders and workers were subjected to murder and enforced disappearance while thousands of others were subjected to repression and harassment by the Awami League regime.</p>
<p>BNP Standing Committee member Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan said Bangladesh was liberated to establish democracy. &ldquo;Almost 53 years after the independence of the country, now we have reached a critical juncture where democracy is dead in Bangladesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come forward to bring back the rights of the people and establish the government of the people. The basic rights of people must be restored in the country. That's why we were on the streets, are on the streets, will be on the streets.""</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-20 20:49:10,

<p>Following the conclusion of a prolonged investigation into the allegations, all of which had a sexual harassment component, while some were exacerbated by academic misconduct, the decision was announced on Tuesday night during a syndicate meeting of the university, according to University Registrar Abu Hasan.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/committee-formed-to-further-probe-sexual-harassment-allegations-against-ju-teacher/111944"">Committee formed to further probe sexual harassment allegations against JU teacher</a></p>
<p>Mahmudur Rahman Johnny, a former Chhatra League leader who even led the JU campus unit of the ruling party student front sought a career in academia, was facing multiple accusations of sexual harassment, which were substantiated by the findings of a structured committee report.</p>
<p>Prior to the conclusion of the trial, there were visible signs of unrest among the students and teachers due to the absence of Vice-Chancellor Nurul Alam Siddique. A committee member, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that Johnny had admitted to all allegations of sexual harassment in a written statement. The committee members were convinced of his guilt, leading to his dismissal from the university.</p>

<p>The decision to take disciplinary action against Johnny in the syndicate meeting has brought relief to the students and faculty who were disturbed by the prolonged trial. Activists involved in the movement against sexual harassment believe that the recent incidents have increased pressure on the university administration to address such issues seriously.</p>
<p>Alif Mahmud, convenor of the JU Chhatra Union, commented on the situation, stating, ""Despite being accused of ethical misconduct, Johnny has openly admitted to his involvement, and the current Vice-Chancellor, Nurul Alam, continues to hold the chair with his support. If he is judged, he will reveal four to five more faces, including the Vice-Chancellor. We believe this is why the Vice-Chancellor is afraid to conduct the trial.""</p>
<p>Anisa Parveen Jolly, a professor in the History Department, expressed optimism that such incidents of sexual harassment would decrease in the future, creating a safer environment for both students and faculty.</p>
<p>Prof. Jolly stated, ""Johnny has violated the sanctity of the classroom, despite being a part of the Environmental Science department. He has roamed the campus with influential teachers from the administration. They have turned the campus into a place where perpetrators, miscreants, and murderers are safe.""</p>

<p>Johnny, a member of the 36th batch of the Department of Environmental Science, served as the president of the JU branch of the Bangladesh Chhatra League in 2012.</p>
<p>In 2018, he was appointed as a lecturer in the Department of Public Health and Informatics, eventually rising to the position of Assistant Professor. Since his appointment, he faced multiple allegations of ""unethical"" relationships with several female students.</p>
<p>On November 21, 2022, an intimate photo (selfie) of Johnny and a lecturer appointed in the same department, was put up on posters across the sprawling JU campus.<br />At the same time, the audio of an intimate conversation with a student of Batch #43, who had applied for a teaching post at the department, came to light, where Johnny forced the victim to have an abortion. Besides, pictures and information of &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; relations between Johnny and several BCL leaders and &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; chats came to light.</p>
<p>In view of this, a section of teachers and students protested demanding proper action against Johnny. <br />Later, on December 8, 2022, a preliminary investigation committee was formed to probe Johnny for allegedly having immoral relations with multiple students. The committee ordered the investigation report by January 31 this year. At that time, Johnny was forced to leave the post of assistant proctor of the university. Still the authorities seemed too indifferent to this plight suffered by - proportionately - a small section of the female student body.</p>

Is an electricity tariff hike imminent?,Karim Waheed,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Others/131329,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/7991622.webp,Bangladesh,Others,Is an electricity tariff hike imminent?,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3996:""<p>In a recent statement, State Minister for Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, Nasrul Hamid, hinted at a forthcoming increase in electricity tariffs starting from March to counter the widening gap between production costs and sales revenues.</p>
<p>This move aims to alleviate financial pressures on the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and the national economy.</p>
<p>""We've to adjust power tariff at both the retail and bulk level to cover the production cost. However, gas prices may be adjusted only for the power plants,"" Hamid declared, assuring that the impact on retail consumers would be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/nepal-sends-tariff-proposal-to-bangladesh-to-export-40-mw-electricity/130425"">Nepal sends tariff proposal to Bangladesh to export 40 MW electricity</a></p>
<p>Sources within the government reveal plans to implement a 5 percent hike in bulk electricity prices and a 3 percent increase at the retail level through an administrative order, bypassing traditional regulatory hearings.</p>
<p>This decision comes after months of deliberation among top policymakers, torn between raising tariffs or leveraging the banking system to issue more bonds.</p>
<p>The dilemma underscores the challenge of managing the substantial financial deficit incurred by the BPDB, with current electricity production costs nearly double the selling price.</p>
<p>According to the BPDB&rsquo;s Annual Report 2022-23, the fiscal year saw the production of 87,024 million kilowatt hours of electricity at a total cost of TK 986.46 billion.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/electricity-demand-may-rise-to-about-17500-mw-in-coming-summer-nasrul/130562"">Electricity demand may rise to about 17,500 MW in coming summer: Nasrul</a></p>
<p>Its per unit production cost was Tk 11.33, while it was selling electricity at Tk 6.7 per unit &mdash; incurring a loss of about Tk 4.63 per unit.</p>
<p>This imbalance has led to a staggering loss of Tk 47,788 crore for the fiscal year, as the government grapples with purchasing power from private and international sources at significantly higher rates.</p>
<p>With this huge loss, the government has been facing great trouble as it has to purchase electricity worth Tk 82,778 crore from private sector power producers, while it generates electricity worth Tk 13,307 crore from its own generation plants.</p>
<p>The annual report also shows that the BPDB&rsquo;s average per unit production cost from its own plants is Tk 7.63, while it is Tk 14.62 at the independent power producers or IPPs (private sector), at rental plants Tk 12.53, at public plants Tk 6.85, and imported power from India at Tk 8.77.</p>
<p>The government purchases electricity from the private sector and India in dollars.</p>
<p>The disparity in production costs between government and private sector plants further exacerbates the financial strain, with the government incurring a cumulative outstanding bill of approximately $5 billion in the energy sector alone.</p>
<p>Hamid also addressed the critical foreign exchange challenge, stating, ""The crisis is not in local currency... But the main crisis is the dollar. We&rsquo;re not getting dollars from Bangladesh Bank as per our needs,"" highlighting the sector's urgent requirement for $1 billion monthly to meet payment obligations.</p>
<p>In response, the government has initiated the issuance of bonds valued at Tk 5,000 crore, potentially rising to Tk 12,000 crore to mitigate some of the financial distress. However, officials acknowledge that this measure, coupled with ongoing subsidies, may not suffice, prompting further considerations for tariff adjustments or additional bond issuances.</p>
<p>As Bangladesh navigates this economic quagmire, the impending decision on electricity tariffs looms large, with potential implications for both the national economy and the everyday lives of its citizens.</p>

ExxonMobil officials in town as govt prepares March bidding round for offshore blocks,Shayan S Khan,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/5422703.webp,Special,,ExxonMobil officials in town as govt prepares March bidding round for offshore blocks,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5980:""<p>The government is planning to float an international tender in March for hydrocarbon exploration in the country&rsquo;s maritime areas, where it would like US oil giant ExxonMobil to participate and show its hand in the bidding round.</p>
<p>The US oil major was conveyed the government&rsquo;s advice when a delegation of the company, led by its Opportunity Manager Jonathan Wilson, met State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid at his office in the ministry on Tuesday (yesterday).</p>
<p>Nearly a year ago, in March 2023, an ExxonMobil spokesperson had confirmed to Upstream, a trade publication in the oil and gas industries, that: &ldquo;ExxonMobil has held initial discussions with Petrobangla regarding Bangladesh&rsquo;s plans for an exploration round.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Special/industries-in-dhaka-gazipur-nganj-still-reeling-from-acute-gas-crisis-despite-titas-claims-of-improvement/131160"">Industries in Dhaka, Gazipur, N'ganj still reeling from acute gas crisis despite Titas claims of improvement</a></p>
<p>The US giant is understood to be particularly interested in the gas potential of Bangladesh&rsquo;s deep-water open blocks and also perhaps its onshore acreage.</p>
<p>Wilson had written a letter to the State Minister expressing his company&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>Petrobangla chairman Zanendra Nath Sarker at the time said: &ldquo;ExxonMobil has placed a primary proposal to negotiate on offshore blocks in deep sea as well as for some onshore blocks. The proposal is now under consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the general election in January this year, ExxonMobil was trying to persuade the government policymakers to accept its offer on an unsolicited basis to allow it for exploration work.</p>
<p>But that proposal was not accepted by the government. Now with greater clarity in the post-election scenario, the US company is once again showing its interest in exploring Bangladesh&rsquo;s offshore blocks, according to well-placed sources at Petrobangla.</p>

<p>Certainly the presence of Jonathan Wilson himself in Dhaka now attests to that as well.</p>
<p>ExxonMobil is one of the handful of companies in the world that has the technical expertise and deep pockets that Bangladesh needs to boost its exploration and production sector following several disappointing licensing rounds and the exit of some other international players in recent years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As part of the move, the company officials met the State Minister,&rdquo; a source at the Energy and Mineral Resources Division, requesting anonymity due to the inherently sensitive nature of dealing with international oil companies (IOCs), told UNB.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government has taken a decision to float international tender in the first week of March, for its offshore blocks.</p>
<p>Earlier, on July 26 last year, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the draft &lsquo;Bangladesh Offshore Model Production Sharing Contract (PSC) 2023&rsquo; in order to invite international bidding for hydrocarbon exploration in offshore areas of the country.</p>
<p>The final approval for the draft Model PSC 2023 was given under a plan to invite the bidding round. It was speculated a September bid might be in the offing, but that eventually fell through as the election was too close and at that stage there was still too much uncertainty to be cleared up.</p>
<p>Now the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office has recently given a go-ahead to the Energy Division&rsquo;s plan for inviting the bidding round in March. Notably the PMO&rsquo;s was the last approval that was missing for a September round, so the fact that it is now comfortable to give the green light signals positive engagement from the very top.</p>
<p>Farhana Sharon, general manager of the Petrobangla, informed that the organisation is taking necessary steps to invite the bidding round as per approval of the PMO.</p>
<p>According to official sources, the new Model PSC was prepared as part of a plan to invite international bidding for offshore deep and shallow water gas blocks, to make Bangladesh more attractive to international oil companies.</p>
<p>Under the initiative, the gas price was tagged with the price of Brent Crude in the international market to ensure flexibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the plan, we&rsquo;re going to offer the price of gas at 10 percent of Brent Crude,&rdquo; the Petrobangla official told UNB.</p>
<p>The official said if Brent Crude is traded at USD $75 per barrel, the gas price would be USD 7.5 per thousand cubic feet (MCF). The gas price will always remain linked to the international oil price, he said, referring to the new provision of the Model PSC 2023.</p>
<p>British oil &amp; gas consultancy Wood Mackenzie has been advising the Bangladesh government and Petrobangla on the latest PSC revisions.</p>
<p>Official sources said the country has a total of 48 blocks, of which 26 are located offshore. Of the 26 offshore blocks, 11 are located in shallow sea (SS) water while 15 are located in deep sea (DS) water areas.</p>
<p>Of the offshore blocks, 24 remain open for IOCs while two blocks &mdash; SS-04 and SS-09 &ndash; are under contract with a joint venture of ONGC Videsh Ltd and Oil India Ltd where drilling work has recently started.</p>
<p>Bangladesh's offshore area remains unexplored despite the settlement of its dispute with neighbouring Myanmar and India over maritime boundary almost nine years ago.</p>
<p>Currently, about 2300 mmcfd gas is being produced from 22 gas fields in the country, while about 600 mmcfd gas is being imported from abroad to meet the demand of about 4000 mmcfd, leaving a deficit of about 1200 mmcfd daily.</p>

Medium of education should be mother language with options open to learn other languages: PM,Julhas Alam,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/PMO/131345,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/6459720.webp,Bangladesh,PMO,Medium of education should be mother language with options open to learn other languages: PM,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5541:""<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said that the medium for education in educational institutions should be everyone&rsquo;s mother tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that our medium for education should be in our mother tongue. Besides, there should be scope to learn other languages too,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said this while inaugurating a four-day programme of the International Mother Language Institute at Segunbagicha to mark the Martyrs&rsquo; Day and the International Mother Language Day-2024.</p>
<p>She said that for education, mother language is the most important thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I trust. If anyone gets education through their mother tongue then receiving that education, knowing that education, understanding that education would become much easier,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But she said that at work the whole world is now so close to each other that learning other languages are also needed.</p>
<p>Sheikh Hasina said that as the children of the country are very much meritorious, it would not be a hard task for them to learn two or three languages.</p>
<p>She mentioned that in many countries of the world this kind of system is present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we have fought for our mother tongue, I think our medium of education should be the mother tongue&hellip;and this should start from the primary level,&rdquo; the PM said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this learning process does not start from the primary level the children would not be capable of receiving it properly.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;This way the path to acquire knowledge will be easier and widened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She criticised the mentality of a section of parents to put their children in English-medium schools sans mother tongue.</p>
<p>She also expressed dissatisfaction that a section of people in the country now pronounce Bangla in an English accent, which sounds very ridiculous.</p>
<p>Hasina, also chief patron of the institute, recalled the contribution of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to the Language Movement in 1952.</p>
<p>She also emphasised on preserving, practising and strengthening own mother tongue, urging all to spread Bangla art, literature and others all over the world through proper translation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our art and literature have to spread all over the world through proper translation alongside preserving our mother tongue, practising our mother tongue and strengthening our mother tongue,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She mentioned that it is the duty of all to highlight the fact that the Bangalee nation has sacrificed life for its own language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The more our art, literature and writings are translated in different languages in different countries of the world, the more the people of the world will know, understand and learn about Bangladesh and the Bangalee nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also observed that the art and literature of different countries can be understood in Bangla language so easily, which is not possible in other languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the culture, literature or history of different countries of the world need to be translated into Bangla to know it in a better way, she added.</p>
<p>The PM said that the International Mother Language Institute (IMLI) and the Bangla Academy should work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we established this institute, we had in mind that if Bangla Academy and the institute work together, we will know art and literature more and more,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheikh Hasina said that it is the duty of every nation to preserve their mother language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that goal in mind, we have established the institute. The institute has been upgraded to category-II by UNESCO,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Education Minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhoury, Prime Minister&rsquo;s Education and Cultural Affairs Advisor Dr. Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury, state minister for Primary and Mass Education and Member of Parliament Rumana Ali and Head of the Office and UNESCO Representative to Bangladesh Susan Maree Vize spoke on the occasion.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Secondary and Higher Education Division Suleman Khan gave the welcome address.</p>
<p>Professor Dr. Shisir Bhattacharja of Institute of Modern Languages of Dhaka University presented the keynote paper.</p>
<p>Director General of the International Mother Language Institute Professor Dr Hakim Arif delivered the vote of thanks.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also distributed prizes and certificates among the winners of the Linguistics Olympiad organised by the International Mother Language Institute.</p>
<p>At the outset, the premier laid a foundation stone of &ldquo;Mujib 100 Years Museum and Archive&rdquo; on the premises of the International Mother Language Institute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheikh Hasina also unveiled covers of &ldquo;Oshomapto Attojiboni&rdquo; (The Unfinished Memoirs) translated in ethnic minority languages, Matrybhasha Pedia and Marty Lingual Pocket Dictionary at the ceremony. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the outset of the programme, a one-minute silence was observed to show respect to the language movement heroes for their sacrifice.</p>
<p>Children from different languages greeted the Prime Minister in their own mother languages on the occasion of the International Mother Language Day.</p>

<p>It recognised Sightsavers&rsquo; meaningful engagement with organisations of people with disabilities (OPDs) and role in strengthening systems in Bangladesh for enrolling, retaining, and ensuring quality primary education for children with disabilities.</p>
<p>Through the Inclusive Futures programme, (funded by UK Aid&rsquo;s flagship disability-inclusive development programme) the international NGO supported children aged between 4-14, who are living with disabilities in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Amrita Rejina Rozario, Country Director of Sightsavers Bangladesh said &ldquo;We are immensely proud to receive the Zero Project award for our inclusive education work and strong partnerships with organisations of people with disabilities (OPDs) such as Spondon.

People with disabilities and their representative organisations need to be included in development programmes to shape and transform the societies that we live in.""</p>
<p>The Zero Project awards recognise organisations that have removed barriers for people with disabilities through their innovative and scalable solutions. Around 1,000 people from 100 countries attended the annual conference at the United Nations&rsquo; Offices in Vienna, where Sightsavers received the Zero Project award.</p>
<p>Sightsavers won the award in partnership with the International Disability Alliance (IDA), a consortium of more than 20 organisations working together to ensure people with disabilities are included in development and humanitarian programmes. Its education projects which integrate children with disabilities into mainstream schools operate in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria and Tanzania.</p>

<p>Alliance Francaise de Dhaka and Hamidur Rahman Cultural Centre in Zinzira, Keraniganj jointly hosted the exhibition.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the French Ambassador paid tribute to the martyrs of the Language Movement marking the International Mother Language Day.</p>
<p><br />She wholeheartedly thanked State Minister Nasrul Hamid for hosting the beautiful exhibition at Hamidur Rahman Cultural Center which she visited for the first time.</p>
<p><br />Ambassador Masdupuy recalled renowned architect Marina Tabassum who designed the Cultural Centre.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;This exhibition is the result of a yearlong project launched by Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise of Dhaka in cooperation with architecture students coming notably from France (&Eacute;cole de la Villette) and Bangladesh (BUET), showcasing the very rich and peculiar history of Puran Dhaka (Old Dhaka) through its architecture and the life and activity around the Buriganga,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;It's here also that Farashganj is located, the old French merchants&rsquo; settlement, and also where the ancestors of the state minister established themselves three hundred years ago,"" the Ambassador said.</p>
<p><br />She concluded by applauding the two French artists who showed them an extraordinary performance with a group of Buriganga coolies about all the industrial and handicraft landscape in Zinzira.</p>
<p><br />Zinzira, nestled on the southern fringes of Dhaka by the Buriganga River, is known for its small industries that serve as the city's backbone. This exhibition not only celebrates the architectural and cultural heritage of Old Dhaka but also fosters a dialogue between the past and the present, showcasing the potential for traditional practices to inform future urban living.</p>
<p>The two-week-long architectural exhibition will continue till March 10 at Hamidur Rahman Cultural Centre of Keraniganj.</p>
<p>State Minister Nasrul Hamid said the topics they explored were the endangered heritage of Old Dhaka, circular economy, urban agriculture, public space allocation systems and the corporate culture of Old Dhaka.</p>
<p>He also said their excellent work will help Bangladeshi architects understand heritage of Dhaka better and use these as reference.</p>
<p>The exhibition is the outcome of a two-week architectural research study by a group of architecture students from the universities of ENSA, Paris la Villette; BUET, Dhaka; BVCOA, Navi Mumbai; C.A.T., Trivandrum; and Mokpo University, South Korea.</p>
<p>They split into several working groups to investigate endangered heritage, circular economy, urban agriculture, innovation as part of traditional activities, informal sectors, public space distribution, and corporate culture in Puran Dhaka (Old Dhaka).</p>
<p>Amid its rapid growth, Dhaka risks losing its architectural and living heritage.</p>
<p>An intricate relationship exists between Puran Dhaka and the river Buriganga, and this field workshop will explore this relationship and highlight the various aspects of living heritage still thriving in the old labyrinths of the city.</p>
<p>A team of 44 students and 12 mentors worked together to map and document these aspects of the old city.</p>
<p>Organisers say the study encompasses various elements, including the evolution of Bara Katra from a residential area in Mughal times to an economic hub for the neighbourhood, albeit losing its original purpose.</p>
<p>It explores the hierarchy of public open spaces in the Armanitola neighbourhood and delves into the traditional craft of Shankhari bangle-making by learning from Shankhari artisans.</p>
<p>Additionally, it examines the preservation of Bangla culture in Tanti Bazar, where the sheen of gold contributes to the swift transformation of the built heritage, they say.</p>
<p>The study also highlights the enduring literary and cultural legacy in Bangla Bazar, the presence of Gol Talab as a rare oasis in densely populated Puran Dhaka, and the changes in the mansions of Zamindars in Mongolabash. Finally, it delves into the wood-to-paper connections in the Farashganj neighbourhood, they say.</p>
<p>The opening was followed by a performance art titled &ldquo;Gaaner Kuli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enthusiasts can visit the exhibition from 10am to 5pm daily.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-21 20:56:25,2024-02-21 22:21:22

"OpenAI, Intel CEOs cite artificial intelligence’s voracious appetite for processing powe",AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Tech News/131388,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/5162633.webp,Tech,Tech News,"OpenAI, Intel CEOs cite artificial intelligence’s voracious appetite for processing powe","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5699:""<p>Two tech CEOs scrambling to produce more of the sophisticated chips needed for artificial intelligence met for a brainstorming session Wednesday while the booming market’s early leader reported another quarter of eye-popping growth.</p>
<p>The on-stage conversation between Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman unfolded in a San Jose, California, convention center a few hours after Nvidia disclosed its revenue for the November-January period nearly quadrupled from the previous year.</p>
<p>Intel, a Silicon Valley pioneer that has been struggling in recent years, laid out its plans for catching up to Nvidia during a daylong conference. Gelsinger kicked things off with a opening speech outlining how he envisions the feverish demand for AI-equipped chips revitalizing his company in a surge he dubbed the “Siliconomy.”</p>
<p>“It’s just magic the way these tiny chips are enabling the modern economic cycle we are in today,” Gelsinger said.</p>
<p>OpenAI, a San Francisco startup backed by Microsoft, has become one of technology’s brightest stars since unleashing its most popular AI innovation, ChatGPT, in late 2022. Altman is now eager to push the envelope even further while competing against Google and other companies such as Anthropic and Inflection AI. But the next leaps he wants to make will take far more processing power than what’s currently available.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/World/donald-trump-again-compares-his-criminal-indictments-to-imprisonment-and-death-of-putins-top-rival/131343"">Donald Trump again compares his criminal indictments to imprisonment and death of Putin’s top rival</a></p>
<p>The imbalance between supply and the voracious appetite for AI chips explains why Altman is keenly interested in securing more money to help expand the industry’s manufacturing capacity. During his talk with Gelsinger, he dodged a question about whether he is trying to raise as much as $7 trillion — more the combined market value of Microsoft and Apple — as was recently reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>“The kernel of truth is we think the world is going to need a lot more (chips for) AI compute,” Altman said. “That is going to require a global investment in a lot of stuff beyond what we are thinking of. We are not in a place where we have numbers yet.”</p>
<p>Altman emphasized the importance of accelerating the AI momentum of the past year to advance a technology that he maintains will lead to a better future for humanity, although he acknowledged there will be downsides along the way.</p>
<p>“We are heading to a world where more content is going to be generated by AI than content generated by humans,” Altman said. “This is not going to be only a good story, but it’s going to be a net good story.”</p>
<p>Perhaps no company is benefiting more from the AI gold rush now than Nvidia. The 31-year-old chipmaker has catapulted to the technological forefront because of its head start in making the graphics processing units, or GPUs, required to fuel popular AI products such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini chatbot.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Nvidia has been a stunning streak of growth that has created more than $1.3 trillion in shareholder wealth in less than 14 months. That has turned it into the fifth most valuable U.S. publicly traded company behind only Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.</p>
<p>Intel, in contrast, has been trying to convince investors that Gelsinger has the Santa Clara, California, company on a comeback trail three years after he was hired as CEO.</p>
<p>Since his arrival, Gelsinger already has pushed the company into the business of making chips for other firms and has committed $20 billion to building new factories in Ohio as part of its expansion into running so-called “foundries” for third parties.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Tech/kolpolok-starts-providing-odoo-erp-software-solution-in-bangladesh/131217"">Kolpolok starts providing Odoo ERP software solution in Bangladesh</a></p>
<p>During Wednesday’s conference, Gelsinger predicted that by 2030 Intel would be overseeing the world’s second largest foundry business, presumably behind the current leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TMSC, largely by meeting the demand for AI chips.</p>
<p>“There’s sort of a space race going on,” Gelsinger told reporters Wednesday after delivering the conference’s keynote speech. “The overall demand (for AI chips) appears to be insatiable for several years into the future.”</p>
<p>Gelsinger’s turnaround efforts haven’t impressed investors so far. Intel’s stock price has fallen by 30% under his reign while Nvidia’s shares have increased by roughly fivefold during the same span.</p>
<p>Intel also is angling for a chunk of the $52 billion that the U.S. Commerce Department plans to spread around in an effort to increase the country’s manufacturing capacity in the $527 billion market for processors, based on last year’s worldwide sales.</p>
<p>Less than $2 billion of the funds available under the 2022 CHIPs and Science Act has been awarded so far, but Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, in a video appearance at Wednesday’s conference, promised “a steady drumbeat” of announcements about more money being distributed.</p>
<p>Raimondo also told Gelsinger that she emerged from recent discussions with Altman and other executives leading the AI movement having a difficult time processing how big the market could become.</p>
<p>“The volume of chips they say they need is mind-boggling,” she said. </p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-22 15:52:05,2024-02-22 16:00:20

<p>“Today the fate of the country’s people has changed since Bangladesh has been marching forward with the ideology that we had learnt from the great sacrifices the people of this country had made on February 21 (the Language Movement) and during the Great Liberation War,” she said.</p>
<p>The premier was addressing a discussion on the occasion of the Language Martyrs' Day and International Mother Language Day-2024 in the city.</p>
<p>Bangladesh Awami League  arranged the discussion in its Dhaka district office in Tejgaon.</p>
<p>AL President Sheikh Hasina, who chaired the discussion, said people of Bangladesh witnessed the upliftment of their socio-economic situation in the last 15 years.</p>
<p>“Evey person up to village level has seen improvement. The development of any country can’t be possible without following an ideology. And this ideology we learnt from February 21,” she said.</p>
<p>The PM said the sacrifice in the 1952 Language Movement had taught the nation to move with an ideology of not to bow down to anyone. “Ekush taught us not to bow down heads, rather move keeping heads high and following an ideology,” she said.</p>
<p>The PM said none can pull Bangladesh back anymore. “We’ve to go forward with this conviction,” she said.</p>
<p>The AL chief said Awami League has gained public trust and confidence as it works for the people. “As a result, the people elected us, voting for us time and again,” she said.</p>
<p>Pointing at BNP, Hasina said they wanted to remove AL from power through movement and resist the election, but failed.</p>
<p>She said the country's most fair, free and impartial election was held on January 7 since 1975.</p>
<p>“Despite thousands of attempts, spreading false accusations and carrying out various lobbying at home and abroad, they could not resist the people from spontaneously casting votes,” she said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said greater number of young and female voters cast their votes this time.</p>
<p>She said now again they (BNP) are making very hollow utterances that they would topple the government through movement.</p>

<p>The AQI scale reveals that values between 201 and 300 signify 'very unhealthy' air quality, directly impacting public health. This range indicates a high risk of adverse health effects, urging residents, especially those in vulnerable groups, to take necessary precautions.</p>
<p>Defined by the concentration of five major air pollutants &mdash; particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone &mdash; the AQI serves as a crucial tool for informing the public about daily air pollution levels and potential health implications.</p>

Conversely, air quality sees relative improvement with the onset of the monsoon season, illustrating the seasonal dynamics of the city's environmental health challenges.</p>

<p>Bangladesh holds a special place in the heart of Kosovar citizens, to begin with the UN peace keeping missions in Kosovo to the unwavering support of Bangladeshi government to Kosovo, said the envoy.</p>
<p>The notable developments in Bangladesh, under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, he said, Kosovo applauds the progress and achievements of Bangladesh and looks forward to further collaboration in various domains.</p>
<p>Two countries have signed three bilateral agreements and MoUs so far.</p>
<p>""We are in the process of negotiating and finalizing three more agreements, on economic cooperation, cultural cooperation, and on the avoidance of double taxation,"" he said.</p>
<p>Last year the two countries had two Ministerial level visits (Minister Dipu Moni to WPS, Defense Minister RKS to Bangladesh) that took place between Kosovo and Bangladesh; and Kosovar President Dr. Vjosa Osmani Sadriu met the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the United Kingdom, which also revealed the determination of both parties to take the relations to the next level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Today, we gather not only to celebrate the resilience and progress of Kosovo but also to acknowledge the significant milestone of six years of diplomatic ties between Kosovo and Bangladesh,"" Kluna added.</p>
<p>The Republic of Kosovo declared its independence on 17th February 2008.</p>
<p>Kosovo experienced a transitional period of less than nine years following its liberation in 1999, with the support of the majority of the international community, including Bangladesh.</p>
<p>""Over the past fifteen years, as the newest country in Europe, the Republic of Kosovo has made remarkable progress in every field. Today we have a functional, prosperous, stable and multi-ethnic State with a diverse society and steadily growing economy,"" said the envoy.</p>
<p>He said Kosovo is optimistic about its future, having a high Human Development Index and a low Gini coefficient, suggesting, progress in social equity since emerging from the 1999 war.</p>
<p>The country has achieved notable success in various sectors, including arts and sports.</p>
<p>Infrastructure for development is in place, and Kosovo aims to become a developed nation in the coming years, said Kluna.</p>
<p>The commitment to EU integration is emphasized, with the submission of a membership application in 2022, anticipating candidate status soon for the benefit of peace, stability, economic development, and regional reconciliation, he said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-23 10:01:04,

<p>She said she told the world leaders that the strength of the policy of a country - not the size - is the way for political and socio-economic freedom.</p>

<p>“Besides, through the bilateral meetings with friendly countries and international organisations the continuation of the relations have become stronger and new horizons of cooperation have been unleashed,” she said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that while speaking at the high-level panel on ‘From Pocket to Planet: Scaling Up Climate Finance’ she called for an immediate end to all hostilities, illegal occupations and inhuman killings of unarmed people, especially women and children, in Gaza and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“I draw everyone's attention to the fact that the adverse effects of economic sanctions and counter-sanctions are felt far beyond the battlefield,” she said.</p>
<p>In this context, she urged everyone to make available and implement the necessary logistics and financing to address the risks of climate change by ending the senseless arms race.</p>
<p>“In the crisis of humanity's existence, I present this harsh reality that petty interests only bring misery. And therefore, call on the international community to take immediate measures to address the growing security risks posed by climate change.”</p>
<p>Hasina said that she called on the world leaders to work together to seriously consider the financing needed to address the challenges posed by climate change.</p>
<p>“I place special emphasis on increasing financing for affected countries and populations, actual transfer of pledged funds, and ensuring financial and technical assistance to vulnerable countries to address the multiple security risks posed by climate change.”</p>
<p>She called for the swift implementation of the political commitments of rich countries and for all concerned to work together on the basis of mutual partnership and cooperation to address the global risk of climate change.</p>
<p>Qatar Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani during his talks assured Qatar's continued support for sustainable and quick solution to the Rohingya problem.</p>
<p>“Besides mutual trade, investment, LNG supply was discussed. We also discussed the need to work together to end Israeli violence in the Gaza Strip,"" she said.</p>
<p>Hasina said that during the meeting with World Bank's Senior Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnership Axel Van Trotsenburge (Axel von Trotsenburg) she called for the speedy release of the US$ 500 million pledged by the World Bank as budget support in the current fiscal year in light of their contribution to the inclusion of middle-income countries.</p>
<p>He assured that the World Bank's assistance will continue in Bangladesh's desired path to pass the status of upper-middle-income and high-income countries.</p>
<p>Director General of the World Health Organization Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, at talks with the PM, lauded Bangladesh’s achievements in health sector, especially in basic health care.</p>
<p>The prime minister referred to her bilateral meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the conference. She said they both expressed their satisfaction with the existing bilateral relations and expressed their desire for bilateral trade cooperation in wheat, edible oil and other agricultural products.</p>
<p>“I urged him to explore effective ways to quickly resolve the Ukraine-Russia conflict. We also discussed about the conflict in the Gaza Strip,” she said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-23 10:49:44,2024-02-23 12:29:05

<p>Firefighters rushed to the scene on the outskirts of the city center as flames burst from windows of the 14-story residential building where the blaze apparently started. Residents could be seen waiting for rescue on balconies, and firefighters used a crane to lift two residents from one of the balconies.</p>
<p>Valencia's assisetant emergency services director, Jorge Su&aacute;rez told reporters that four people were confirmed dead and that some six hours hours after the blaze started firefighters were trying to cool down the outside of the building before attempting to go inside.</p>
<p>Soldiers from Spain&rsquo;s Military Emergency Unit also were deployed and medics set up a large tent to tend to the injured on the scene.</p>

<p>The fire sent clouds of black smoke billowing skyward that could be seen from afar. Spain's weather agency, Aemet, reported winds of up to 60 kph (40 mph) at the time.</p>
<p>The fire began in the early evening and spread to an adjacent building, state news agency Efe reported. Emergency service reports said that besides the four people killed, at least 13 were injured, most with fractures, burns and smoke inhalation. The 13 included six firefighters.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how many people were in the buildings or how many were rescued.</p>
<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S&aacute;nchez posted a tweet on the X platform saying he was &ldquo;shocked by the terrible fire in a building in Valencia,&rdquo; adding that he had offered the city &ldquo;all the help that is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I protest such things. I am conscious enough over my power whatever I have. I don&rsquo;t think that I need to do anything bigger than it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Answering a question, the PM said in the next five years, her government&rsquo;s focus will be on the progress of Bangladesh as a developing nation as the country will start its journey as a developing country in 2026. &nbsp;&ldquo;We have already formed various committees and are working in that way,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She said there is a lack of true political parties in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Awami League was formed in 1949 to raise public voice and then marched forward, leading movements and struggles. But no other party in Bangladesh has such history, she said, adding that Jamaat is a party of war criminals and BNP and Jatiya Party were born from the pockets of military dictators.</p>

<p>Since its inception on December 18 in 1972, Bangladesh Supreme Court has been working to protect basic human rights of people, establish rule of law and provide justice to litigants within the shortest possible time, the President mentioned.</p>
<p>Recalling with deep respect the role of those brave judges and lawyers of the Supreme Court who never bowed down to the gun-point and never sold their conscience, he said whenever necessary during the transitional time of the nation, the Supreme Court has established the basic human rights of the people and protected the constitution by fulfilling the duties assigned to it.</p>
<p>Saying that the existing bilateral ties between the neighboring Bangladesh and India in South Asia are excellent , the President said two friendly countries have crossed unique paths in their respective journeys to establish rule of law, develop democracy and protect constitutional continuity.</p>
<p>Since independence, bilateral and diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and India are gradually expanding in various sectors, including trade and investment, he added.</p>
<p>President Shahabuddin said both Bangladesh and India have witnessed instances where the Judiciary has intervened to protect the rights of marginalized communities, uphold the principles of environment-based sustainable development and good governance.</p>
<p>Calling India as our closest neighbor and friendly country, the President expressed sincere thanks and gratitude on behalf of the people of Bangladesh for India's whole-hearted cooperation and solidarity to the Bangladesh War of Liberation in 1971.</p>
<p>The judiciary, judges and people of both countries can benefit by exchanging experience and training programs between the judiciary, judges and related officials of the two countries, he opined.</p>
<p>The President said through the exchange of experience and training programmes between the judiciary judges and related officials of the two countries, the judges and people of both countries can get benefits.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;s:25:""news/details/6979537.webp"";}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-23 14:30:18,2024-02-23 23:24:54
Australia beat New Zealand by 72 runs in 2nd T20 to win series,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Cricket/131450,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/7691287.webp,Sports,Cricket,Australia beat New Zealand by 72 runs in 2nd T20 to win series,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5060:""<p>Adam Zampa took 4-34 as Australia rolled New Zealand for 102 in 17 overs to win the second Twenty20 international by 72 runs Friday and take an insurmountable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.</p>
<p>The Australians will head towards the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and United States in June with more confidence after a comprehensive series win over New Zealand which is the world&rsquo;s second-ranked team.</p>
<p>Australia won the first match by six wickets with a four off the last ball and the third match between the teams is at Eden Park on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great win for Australia,&rdquo; captain Mitch Marsh said. &ldquo;Our backs were against the wall and we thought we were probably 50 runs short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the way our bowlers came out and performed was outstanding. All of our teams over the last 12 months have been backed into a lot of corners and we&rsquo;ve managed to find a way to get out of them. Tonight was another example of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Australia looked to have fallen short of a competitive total when it was bowled out for 174 in 19.5 overs after being 72-1 at the end of the six-over power play.</p>
<p>Opener Travis Head blasted 45 from 22 balls including five sixes to give Australia a fast start as it batted after losing the toss. But Lockie Ferguson took 4-12 and Ben Sears 2-29 as the New Zealand seamers turned things around and provoked a sustained collapse of the Australian innings.</p>
<p>Australia lost six wickets for 59 runs in the last 9.5 overs.</p>
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s batting was depleted by the loss of Rachin Ravindra just before the start of play with a slight knee injury and Devon Conway suffered a thumb injury keeping wicket and was taken to hospital for X-rays. He returned to the ground when it was found there was no fracture.</p>
<p>Conway still was unable to bat and his opening partner Finn Allen had to take the gloves for the first time in his international career.</p>
<p>Regardless of injuries, New Zealand collapsed in the face of outstanding Australian fast bowling on a fast and bouncy wicket.</p>

<p>Allen hit a six from the third ball of the first over and was out to the last ball, walking down to a good length ball from Josh Hazlewood which he edged onto his stumps.</p>
<p>Will Young (5) was promoted to open and was out to a brilliant catch by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade. Young top-edged a ball from Pat Cummins which he had attempted to pull and Wade took a catch on the edge of the circle running back toward fine leg.</p>
<p>New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner promoted himself from his regular place at No. 7 to No. 3 in the order and was 7 when he chopped a short ball from Nathan Ellis onto his stumps.</p>
<p>Mark Chapman also fell to a short ball, slashing at a ball from Marsh which was caught by Tim David at mid-on. New Zealand was 29-4 and its hopes of saving the series looked over.</p>
<p>Glenn Phillips and Josh Clarkson put on 45 for the fifth wicket in a brief display of defiance. But Clakson was bowled by Adam Zampa when he was 10 and Adam Milne fell in the same fashion to the next ball. New Zealand was 74-6.</p>
<p>Head was impressive at the top of the Australian order, blasting 20 runs including two sixes from the first over of the match bowled by Trent Boult.</p>
<p>Boult was recalled to the New Zealand team for his first T20 international since November 2022 and hoped to win a place in the Black Caps squad for the World Cup. But his four overs cost 49 runs and his selection chances have dimmed. Boult is no longer a New Zealand contracted player but plays in T20 leagues around the world.</p>

<p>Australia also made lineup changes, naming Steve Smith to open with Head in place of David Warner who played in the first match at Wellington. Wade came in for Matt Short and Ellis for Mitchell Starc.</p>
<p>Smith was out in the third over for 11 but Head kept up a savage attack which carried Australia to 50 from 24 balls.</p>
<p>Head finally was out in the seventh over when the total was 85-2. From then on the Australian batting effort waned and Ferguson was the main cause, producing some extraordinary fast bowling.</p>
<p>He was backed up by Sears and by Adam Milne, who took 2-40. Those players have solidified their places in New Zealand&rsquo;s World Cup squad.</p>
<p>Marsh made 26 from 21 balls before falling to Santner who took 2-35 and Cummins made a valuable 28 from 22 balls before being caught by Ferguson off Milne&rsquo;s bowling.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-23 16:38:27,

US and EU pile new sanctions on Russia for the Ukraine war's 2nd anniversary and Navalny's death,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/USA/131457,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/8400487.webp,World,USA,US and EU pile new sanctions on Russia for the Ukraine war's 2nd anniversary and Navalny's death,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3979:""<p>The United States and the European Union are piling new sanctions on Russia on the eve of the second anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine and in retaliation for the death of noted Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny last week in an Arctic penal colony.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department plans Friday to impose more than 500 new sanctions on Russia and its war machine in the largest single tranche of penalties since Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. They come on the heels of a series of new arrests and indictments announced by the Justice Department on Thursday that target Russian businessmen, including the head of Russia&rsquo;s second-largest bank, and their middlemen in five separate federal cases.</p>
<p>The European Union announced Friday that it is imposing sanctions on several foreign companies over allegations that they have exported dual-use goods to Russia that could be used in its war against Ukraine. The 27-nation bloc also said that it was targeting scores of Russian officials, including &ldquo;members of the judiciary, local politicians and people responsible for the illegal deportation and military re-education of Ukrainian children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The American people and people around the world understand that the stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine,&rdquo; President Joe Biden said in a statement announcing the sanctions. &ldquo;If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going. And the costs to the United States &mdash; along with our NATO Allies and partners in Europe and around the world &mdash; will rise.""</p>
<p>The U.S. specifically was to target individuals associated with Navalny's imprisonment a day after Biden met with the opposition leader's widow and daughter in California. It was also hitting &ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s financial sector, defense industrial base, procurement networks and sanctions evaders across multiple continents,&rdquo; Biden said. &ldquo;They will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The EU asset freezes and travel bans constitute the 13th package of measures imposed by the bloc against people and organizations it suspects of undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, we are further tightening the restrictive measures against Russia&rsquo;s military and defense sector,&rdquo; EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. &ldquo;We remain united in our determination to dent Russia&rsquo;s war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all, 106 more officials and 88 &ldquo;entities&rdquo; &mdash; often companies, banks, government agencies or other organizations &mdash; have been added to the bloc&rsquo;s sanctions list, bringing the tally of those targeted to more than 2,000 people and entities, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and his associates.</p>
<p>Companies making electronic components, which the EU believes could have military as well as civilian uses, were among 27 entities accused of &ldquo;directly supporting Russia&rsquo;s military and industrial complex in its war of aggression against Ukraine,&rdquo; a statement said.</p>
<p>Those companies &mdash; some of them based in India, Sri Lanka, China, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Thailand and Turkey &mdash; face tougher export restrictions. The names of the companies will only be made public once they are published in the EU&rsquo;s official journal, which should be a matter of days.</p>
<p>The bloc said the companies &ldquo;have been involved in the circumvention of trade restrictions,&rdquo; and it accuses others of &ldquo;the development, production and supply of electronic components&rdquo; destined to help Russia&rsquo;s armed forces.</p>
<p>Some of the measures are aimed at depriving Russia of parts for pilotless drones, which are seen by military experts as key to the war.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-23 19:06:58,

US and EU pile new sanctions on Russia for the Ukraine war's 2nd anniversary and Navalny's death,Mahamuda Alam Simi,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Others/131473,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/1322076.webp,World,Others,US and EU pile new sanctions on Russia for the Ukraine war's 2nd anniversary and Navalny's death,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:8047:""<p>The United States and European Union on Friday heaped hundreds of new sanctions on Russia in connection with the second anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine and in retaliation for the death of noted Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny last week in an Arctic penal colony.</p>
<p>The U.S. government imposed roughly 600 new sanctions on Russia and its war machine in the largest single round of penalties since Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.</p>
<p>The EU, for its part, added sanctions on several foreign companies over allegations that they have exported dual-use goods to Russia that could be used in its war against Ukraine. The 27-nation bloc also targeted scores of Russian officials, including members of the judiciary, local politicians and people it said were ""responsible for the illegal deportation and military re-education of Ukrainian children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said the sanctions come in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s &ldquo;brutal war of conquest&rdquo; and to Navalny&rsquo;s death, adding that &ldquo;we in the United States are going to continue to ensure that Putin pays a price for his aggression abroad and repression at home.""</p>
<p>But while previous sanctions have increased costs for Russia&rsquo;s ability to fight in Ukraine, they appear to have done little so far to deter Putin and it was unclear that the latest big round would significantly alter that.</p>
<p>In specific response to Navalny&rsquo;s death, the State Department targeted three Russian officials the U.S. says are connected to his death, including the deputy director of Russia&rsquo;s Federal Penitentiary Service, who was promoted by Putin to the rank of colonel general on Monday, three days after Navalny died.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/ukraines-pm-scheduled-to-have-stopover-in-dhaka-tonight/131303"">Ukraine&rsquo;s PM scheduled to have stopover in Dhaka tonight</a></p>
<p>The sanctions bar the officials from traveling to the U.S. and block access to U.S.-owned property. But they appear largely symbolic given that the officials are unlikely to travel to or have assets or family in the West.</p>
<p>White House national security spokesman John Kirby said to &ldquo;expect more&rdquo; action later related to Navalny's death, adding that ""today this just a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Biden administration is levying additional sanctions as House Republicans are blocking billions of dollars in additional aid to Ukraine. The war is becoming entangled in U.S. election-year politics, with former President Donald Trump voicing skepticism about the benefits of the NATO alliance and saying that he would &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; Russia to &ldquo;do whatever the hell they want&rdquo; to countries that, in his view, are not pulling their weight in the alliance.</p>
<p>Biden on Friday called on Congress to pass Ukraine aid, which has stalled since House Speaker Mike Johnson blocked votes on aid passed by the Senate for Ukraine and other countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russia is taking Ukraine territory for the first time in many months,&rdquo; Biden said. &ldquo;But here in America, the speaker gave the house a two week vacation. They have to come back and get this done, because failure to support Ukraine in this critical moment will never be forgotten in history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biden spoke later Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron about Russia&rsquo;s recent actions and the need to support Ukraine. A White House readout said they also discussed developments in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Many of the new U.S. sanctions announced Friday target Russian firms that contribute to the Kremlin&rsquo;s war effort &mdash; like drone and industrial chemical manufacturers and machine tool importers &mdash; as well as financial institutions, such as the state-owned operator of Russia&rsquo;s Mir National Payment System.</p>
<p>The U.S. also will impose visa restrictions on Russian authorities it says are involved in the kidnapping and confinement of Ukrainian children. In addition, 26 third-country people and firms from across China, Serbia, the United Arab Emirates, and Liechtenstein are listed for sanctions, for assisting Russia in evading existing financial penalties.</p>
<p>The Russian foreign ministry called the EU sanctions &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; and said they undermine &ldquo;the international legal prerogatives of the UN Security Council.&rdquo; In response, the ministry is banning some EU citizens from entering the country because they have provided military assistance to Ukraine. It did not immediately address the U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>Overall, since the start of the war, the U.S. Treasury and State departments have targeted more than 4,000 officials, oligarchs, firms, banks and others under Russia-related sanctions authorities. The EU asset freezes and travel bans constitute its 13th package of measures imposed by the bloc against people and organizations it suspects of undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, we are further tightening the restrictive measures against Russia&rsquo;s military and defense sector,&rdquo; EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. &ldquo;We remain united in our determination to dent Russia&rsquo;s war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all, 106 more officials and 88 &ldquo;entities&rdquo; &mdash; often companies, banks, government agencies or other organizations &mdash; have been added to the bloc&rsquo;s sanctions list, bringing the tally of those targeted to more than 2,000 people and entities, including Putin and his associates.</p>
<p>Companies making electronic components, which the EU believes could have military as well as civilian uses, were among 27 entities accused of &ldquo;directly supporting Russia&rsquo;s military and industrial complex in its war of aggression against Ukraine,&rdquo; a statement said.</p>

<p>Some of the measures are aimed at depriving Russia of parts for pilotless drones, which are seen by military experts as key to the war.</p>
<p>A $60 per barrel price cap has also been imposed on Russian oil by Group of Seven allies, intended to reduce Russia&rsquo;s revenues from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Critics of the sanctions, price cap and other measures meant to stop Russia&rsquo;s invasion say they are not working fast enough.</p>
<p>Maria Snegovaya, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that primarily sanctioning Russia&rsquo;s defense industry and failing to cut meaningfully into Russia&rsquo;s energy revenues will not be enough to halt the war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One way or another, they will have to eventually address Russia&rsquo;s oil revenues and have to consider an oil embargo,&rdquo; Snegovaya said. &ldquo;The oil price cap has effectively stopped working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo, in previewing the new sanctions, told reporters that the U.S. and its allies will not lower the price cap; &ldquo;rather what we&rsquo;ll be doing is taking actions that will increase the cost&rdquo; of Russia&rsquo;s production of oil.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department says the current cap is working, with an agency analysis finding that Kremlin oil tax revenue was more than 40 percent lower in the first nine months of 2023 because of it.</p>
<p>Adeyemo added that &ldquo;sanctions alone are not enough to carry Ukraine to victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We owe the Ukrainian people who have held on for so long the support and resources they desperately need to defend their homeland and prove Putin wrong once and for all time.&rdquo;</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-24 08:53:09,

PM blaming BNP for essentials’ price hike to hide govt’s failures: Rizvi,Kazi Farzana Haque,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/BNP/131490,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/1147324.webp,Politics,BNP,PM blaming BNP for essentials’ price hike to hide govt’s failures: Rizvi,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:3354:""<p style=""text-align: justify;"">BNP on Saturday alleged that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blamed BNP for the hikes in the prices of essential commodities just to mislead the people and hide her government&rsquo;s failure.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;The syndicate government formed through a dummy election is misleading the people by making strange remarks. The government, which has completely failed to control commodity prices, is now blaming BNP for the increase in the prices of essential items,&rdquo; said BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Speaking at a press briefing, at the party&rsquo;s Nayapaltan central office, he also said the PM at her Friday&rsquo;s press conference at&nbsp;Ganabhaban said&nbsp;those who are agitating to overthrow the government have some tricks to increase the commodity prices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""Her such statements mean that her autocracy has become rotten and perverted. Therefore, Sheikh Hasina has no choice but to utter blatant lies and make untrue, fabricated and baseless comments. All these statements are the manifestation of a disturbed mind... that's why she&rsquo;s resorting to ridiculous lies,&rdquo; Rizvi said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, he said, the Prime Minister has admitted that commodity prices have gone up limitlessly. ""They (govt) have an old habit of shamelessly blaming BNP for their failures, looting, stealing, and misdeeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since Sheikh Hasina is unable to control the dishonest businessmen as the head of the government, Rizvi said she is spreading false propaganda to blame BNP for her failure to stay in power illegally. &ldquo;The looter government does not have the minimum competence to control the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">​The BNP leader said the common people are going through a very tough time to survive amid the skyrocketing prices of all commodities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said though the government had issued various threats it could not control the market as the market manipulators are now controlling the Awami League regime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;The way price of every commodity is increasing, not only the lower-income people but also the middle class ones have become extremely helpless. People are unable to buy necessary daily essential items, including rice, lentils, oil, onion, garlic and chicken. The beef and mutton are now becoming like a distant star in the sky for the poor people,&rdquo; Rizvi observed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">BNP Chairperson&rsquo;s Advisory Council member Habibur Rahman Habib is seriously ill, but the jail authorities are not providing him with necessary treatment, he alleged.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""His (Habib&rsquo;s) condition is serious. He is not being treated in jail and he is not being given proper prescriptions and medicines. He can't even walk,&rdquo; the BNP leader said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He called upon the government to take immediate steps to ensure better treatment of ailing Habib since 15 jailed opposition leaders have recently died in custody.</p>

Many in Myanmar consider fleeing to Thailand to escape conscription into an army they despise,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Asia/131524,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/5906033.webp,World,Asia,Many in Myanmar consider fleeing to Thailand to escape conscription into an army they despise,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:7952:""<p>Thwel, a 25-year-old schoolteacher, saw very few options left to her after Myanmar&rsquo;s military announced it is implementing conscription to fill its ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a person living in this country, I only have two options: to go abroad illegally or die here,&rdquo; Thwel told The Associated Press by phone while traveling to a border area to try crossing into Thailand with a small group of like-minded people.</p>
<p>Some observers believe a mass exodus of young talent is taking place and could become a social problem, with their exit heightening the instability that followed the military takeover that now amounts to a civil war.</p>
<p>Thwel, whose home in Myanmar&rsquo;s southern Mon state is the scene of occasional combat between the army and resistance forces, spoke on condition she be called by only one name as protection from the military authorities. Like many professionals, she joined the Civil Disobedience Movement that was formed to oppose military rule after the army&rsquo;s 2021 seizure of power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>Since then, the army's manpower has been stretched thin by increasing pressure from surprisingly durable pro-democracy resistance forces and ethnic minority armed organizations,</p>
<p>Over the past four months, opposition groups scored significant victories and seized strategically important territory in northern Shan state where Myanmar borders China, and in Rakhine state in the west.</p>
<p>On Feb. 10, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, chair of Myanmar&rsquo;s ruling military council, ordered the 2010 conscription law be activated to replenish the ranks that have been depleted by the struggle to quash a nationwide pro-democracy insurgency. All healthy men ages 18-35 and women 18-27 are required to register for two years of military service.</p>
<p>Evading conscription is punishable by three to five years in prison and a fine.</p>
<p>Of Myanmar's 56 million people, about 14 million &mdash; 6.3 million men and 7.7 million women &mdash; are eligible for military service, according to Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, the spokesperson for the military government. The government will draft 60,000 people a year, with an initial batch of 5,000 to be called up soon after the traditional Thingyan New Year celebration in mid-April, he said.</p>
<p>After an uproar over the initial announcement, Zaw Min Tun said there is no plan to call women into military service yet &mdash; meaning schoolteacher Thwel might actually be in the clear for the time being.</p>
<p>But many people are actively looking for ways to escape.</p>
<p>The street in front of Thailand&rsquo;s embassy in Yangon has been filled with visa applicants queued up to get numbered appointment tickets. Overwhelmed, the embassy announced it would accept only 400 visa appointments per day, and they must be made online. According to the Thai Foreign Ministry, some 7,000 Myanmar nationals have applied for visas, Thailand&rsquo;s Bangkok Post newspaper reported Thursday.</p>
<p><a href=""https://unb.com.bd/category/World/the-body-of-russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-has-been-handed-over-to-his-mother-aide-says/131519"">The body of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been handed over to his mother, aide says</a></p>
<p>Each day at the state passport office in Mandalay, Myanmar&rsquo;s second-largest city, 4,000-5000 people were lining up to get one of the 200-250 daily appointment tickets. Two women died and one was injured after they fell into a ditch in a pre-dawn rush to get a coveted early place in line.</p>
<p>A 32-year-old news translator from Yangon said he made a snap decision to leave the country after the conscription announcement, and flew to Thailand a few days later. Like almost all persons willing to discuss their plans, he spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of the legal consequences.</p>
<p>He said he was very concerned because serving in the military is like entering a labyrinth with no way back out, giving the example of his uncle, who joined the army for a five-year enlistment but was not allowed to leave for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>A 26-year-old journalist who has been working covertly in Mandalay, said the conscription law made his situation untenable. He also spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of the legal consequences; more than 150 journalists were arrested after the army sized power, and more than one-third remain locked up, according to the Paris-based press freedom group Reporters Without Borders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried my best to stay inside the country in the past few years while other journalists were fleeing abroad or to areas controlled by ethnic minority armed groups,"" he said. ""But, this time, we can&rsquo;t hide anywhere. We can&rsquo;t stay out of sight. There is no choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is also planning to flee to Thailand.</p>
<p>The Institute for Strategy and Policy, an independent think tank, said conscription could trigger a mass exodus, more widespread violations of human rights and increase corruption and extortion at all levels. It anticipates that young people close to areas where armed conflict is active could join the ethnic minority armed forces and pro-democracy resistance groups.</p>
<p>There were around 160,000 soldiers before the army takeover, the institute said, and there are now fewer than 100,000 due to casualties, desertions and defection.</p>
<p>Like schoolteacher Thwel, a 35-year old doctor from Yangon had joined the Civil Disobedience Movement. He was consequently restricted from treating patients, since activist medical workers are boycotting government hospitals, while private clinics and hospitals risk closure if they hire them. They are also blacklisted by immigration authorities, making them unable to get passports to legally leave the country.</p>
<p>Professionals such as medical doctors and engineers face a higher age limit for conscription &mdash; 45 for men and 35 for women &mdash; and their term of service is three years.</p>
<p>""For me, the announcement of the law was the impetus to make a decision to go abroad,&rdquo; said the doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for his safety.</p>
<p><a href=""https://unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/qatar-assures-support-for-bangladeshs-media-sector-development/131523"">Qatar assures support for Bangladesh's media sector development</a></p>
<p>The doctor said he was exploring the best ways flee abroad or to border areas controlled by the ethnic armed groups.</p>
<p>Ethnic resistance groups such as the Arakan Army from Rakhine state and the Shan State Progress Party have invited people to take refuge in territory they control. The Karen National Union in Kayin state in the southeast has similarly promised help.</p>
<p>Myanmar&rsquo;s shadow National Unity Government, the leading political body of the pro-democracy resistance, declared that the public is not required to comply with the conscription law, urging them instead to intensify their participation in the fight against army rule.</p>
<p>The Yangon region branch of its armed wing, the People&rsquo;s Defense Force, announced a recruitment drive and said they received about 1,000 online applications within 12 hours.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 working-age Myanmar nationals are believed to be crossing into Thailand every day since conscription was announced, said Moe Kyaw of the Yaung Chi Oo Workers Association-Thailand, an aid association for Myanmar migrant workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a good sign that human resources and intellectuals leave a country,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He echoed other aid workers in predicting that with new waves of people entering Thailand, generally illegally, there will be increased human trafficking and related crimes, and there will be friction as the new entrants compete for jobs with as many as 3 million already employed Myanmar migrant workers.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-25 12:43:24,

<p><br />&ldquo;Equal opportunity has been created for all,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><br />Her call came during a speech at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in Dhaka, celebrating National Local Government Day 2024, themed &ldquo;Local government will be smart: Rights to services will be ensured.&rdquo;</p>

Bappa Mazumder enthrals music lovers with majestic ‘Odyssey’,UNB NEWS,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/4132237.webp,Special,,Bappa Mazumder enthrals music lovers with majestic ‘Odyssey’,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:2:{i:0;s:3038:""<p>Bappa Mazumder, one of the most popular and respected superstars in the country’s music industry for his melodious numbers, once again enamoured fans at just the second solo concert of his iconic career.</p>
<p>The concert, titled “Bappa Mazumder’s Odyssey,” was held at the KIB auditorium in the capital on Friday night, where the National Award-Winning singer, music composer and the frontman of Dalchhut showcased a majestic three-hour-long performance delivering 27 songs.</p>
<p>Opened by Masha Islam, one of the most promising and popular singers in recent times, the concert was joyfully joined by a thousand listeners who accompanied Bappa Mazumder on his magical voyage of melodious Bangla songs in the glorious month of February.</p>
<p>The concept inspiration of the musical event was taken from the style of classical Greek art, based on the literary theme of a hero's journey. The name ‘Odyssey’ was taken from Homer's epic Odyssey, where Odysseus goes on his hero's journey.</p>
<p>The event began with Masha Islam performing a selection of contemporary Bangla hits, including ""Harano Diner Moto,"" ""Tomake Chhuye Dilam,"" and ""Jao Pakhi Bolo,"" before Bappa's melodic journey on this historic night of his legendary career. She also performed a lovely duet rendition of Bappa's ""Chokheri Jole Vashabo Bole"" later on the night, with the night's star.</p>
<p>Taking over the stage with his gentlemen’s attire, his classy gestures, and a band of brothers, Bappa Mazumdar started his history-making ‘Odyssey’ with the song “Shopnopure” and continued performing 13 of his superhit tracks including ”Din Bari Jay,” “Mon Chhuyechho,” “Brishti Pore,” Surjo Snane Chol” and more. </p>
<p>During this set of performances, he remembered his long-lost musical companion, the late Bangladeshi singer-songwriter and writer Sanjeeb Chowdhury while performing Dalchhut’s popular track “Ami Firey Pete Chai” - and also introduced the lyricist of his popular track “Kokhono Ichchhe Hoy” to the crowd, Mass Masum from the audience while performing the track.</p>
<p>The singer concluded the first set of performances after 13 tracks with “Chaichho Jokhon,” and the concertgoers roamed around outside the auditorium during the break as the premise was decorated with stalls of the sponsors of the event with their refreshment offerings and merchandise. There was an installation at the venue featuring one line from all the songs Bappa performed at the concert.</p>
<p>After the short break, Bappa returned and resumed the voyage to perform the rest of the tracks, starting with “Dhulo Pora Chithi.” He then goes on performing his superhits one after another, including “Raater Train,” a beautiful rendition of the legendary Lucky Akhand’s iconic track “Agey Jodi Janitam,” “Jochhonabihar,” “Kipte Bariwala,” Sanjeeb Chowdhury’s another blissfully majestic track “Ami Tomakei Bole Debo,” Bappa’s own smashing hit song “Pori,” and more.</p>
<p> </p>"";i:1;s:2534:""<p>During the performances, Bappa often greeted the live crowd by asking them whether they were enjoying the concert or not. He introduced the ensemble set of performers who were flamboyantly accompanying the melody king, starting with Masum W Rahman (Electric Guitar), Tomal (Acoustic Guitar), Sohel Aziz and Shohag (Keyboards), John S Munshi (Bass), Dano Sheikh (Drums), Mithun (Percussion), Anondo (Saaj/Mandolin), Shawon Gaanwala and Antora Rahman (Backing Vocals).&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also thanked singer-musician Khayam Sanu Sandhi alongside conveying gratitude to the crew behind the amazing sound and lightings, and lyricist Shahan Kabondho for managing all communication and coordination for the show.</p>
<p>Sharing a funny story with the crowd before performing his popular, humorous song &ldquo;Kipte Bariwala,&rdquo; Bappa said that after the release of the song, his then-landlord of the tenanted house where he used to live along with his mother, eminent Bangladeshi classical vocalist Ila Mazumder, raised an uncomfortable question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landlord was very close and friendly to us but after hearing the track, he asked my mother why I made that song after him,&rdquo; Bappa shared, creating a moment of laughter with the audience.</p>
<p>An acclaimed music producer who won the National Award for contributing his musical talent to the country&rsquo;s film industry, Bappa also performed two of his popular tracks from the movie &lsquo;Satta&rsquo; at the concert. He sang &ldquo;Tor Premete Ondho,&rdquo; originally sung by rock icon James under his composition, and &rdquo;Na Jani Kon Oporadhe,&rdquo; sung by folk icon Momotaz in the film.</p>
<p>Expressing their utmost pleasure to UNB over the arrangement and overall sound management of the concert, several of the concertgoers expressed that this has been one of the most tremendously organised and well-curated concerts in recent times. Karkhana Studios was behind the organization, execution, and concept planning of the event, while Studio Shwo was the design partner, and Blues Communication provided the sound equipment.</p>
<p>Concluding the successful concert with Dalchhut&rsquo;s iconic track &ldquo;Baazi,&rdquo; Bappa bid adieu to the crowd, thanking them for their support and love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Organizing the ticket-based concerts nowadays is a great challenge, but it&rsquo;s your love and support that keeps us going. Thank you so much for making this concert a memorable experience for me,&rdquo; Bappa Mazumder said.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:2:{i:0;s:25:""news/details/2416165.webp"";i:1;s:25:""news/details/8994388.webp"";}s:8:""captions"";a:2:{i:0;s:15:""Photo: Courtesy"";i:1;s:15:""Photo: Courtesy"";}s:3:""alt"";a:2:{i:0;N;i:1;N;}}",2024-02-25 16:17:25,2024-02-25 21:19:44

Why Are We Asked to Put Our Phones on Airplane Mode During Flights?,"Rifat Tabassam, Karim Waheed",https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Tech News/131569,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/3487540.webp,Tech,Tech News,Why Are We Asked to Put Our Phones on Airplane Mode During Flights?,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:2:{i:0;s:2592:""<p>Ever wondered why you're asked to <strong>put your phone on airplane mode during flights</strong>? It's a common request once the plane doors close and the flight attendants start their safety instructions. While it might be tough to disconnect, especially on longer flights, airplane mode is necessary. But what exactly is it, and why do airlines insist on it? Let's dive into the science behind this familiar practice and <strong>why it's still essential for your phone use during air travel</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Airplane Mode?</strong></h2>
<p>Airplane mode is a setting available on smartphones that disables all wireless communication features. When activated, it turns off the phone's ability to connect to cellular networks, Wi-Fi signals, and Bluetooth devices. This means that calls, text messages, and notifications will not be received or sent while airplane mode is active. The purpose of airplane mode is to prevent potential interference with aircraft communication systems during flight, making it a requirement for many airlines during the journey.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Must Passengers Put Their Phones on Airplane Mode During Flights?</strong></h2>
<p>Airplane mode is crucial during flights to prevent any potential interference with sensitive airplane systems. These systems, including communication and navigation systems, rely on radio frequencies emitted from the ground. However, cell phones and tablets also use these frequencies for various functions like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and data transmission. The problem arises when crosstalk or adjacent-channel interference occurs, where one radio receiver picks up transmissions from nearby frequencies, disrupting the intended signals. This interference can be compared to tuning into a radio station and hearing another station's transmission on a nearby frequency.</p>

<p>Particularly during crucial moments like landing or emergencies, clear communication between the aircraft and ground control is vital. Airplane mode ensures that these communication lines remain open and interference-free. Additionally, with the advent of 5G technology, the risk of interference has increased, as signals from ground antennas and 5G devices might interfere with the airplane's radio altimeters, which gauge the distance from the ground during descent and landing. Therefore, using airplane mode helps ensure safe and uninterrupted communication during flights.</p>"";i:1;s:3036:""<h2><strong>What Happens If You Don&rsquo;t Put Your Phone on Airplane Mode?</strong></h2>
<p>If you forget to turn on airplane mode during a flight or choose to ignore the rules, the risk might seem low, but the potential consequences are serious. Pilots rely on the airplane's radio altimeters to determine the exact height above the ground, especially during challenging landings in poor visibility conditions like fog or snow. If a passenger's 5G-capable device isn't in airplane mode, it could send a signal that interferes with the airplane's radio altimeter, providing inaccurate height readings.</p>
<p>This misinformation could lead to dangerous situations during critical phases of flight, particularly during landing. Even if it's just one person disregarding the rules, it only takes one wrong signal and certain conditions for a disaster to occur. Therefore, it's essential to adhere to airplane mode regulations to ensure the safety of everyone onboard.</p>
<h2><strong>Is There Any Benefit of Putting the Phone on Airplane Mode?</strong></h2>
<p>Putting your phone on airplane mode during a flight offers several advantages. Firstly, it helps save a phone's battery life because it stops searching for cellular networks or Wi-Fi signals. This means your battery will last longer. Additionally, airplane mode speeds up charging because apps stop downloading updates, allowing your phone to charge faster. You'll also experience fewer interruptions without constant notifications and messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Tech/how-ai-can-improve-education/119364"">How AI Can Improve Education</a></p>
<p>Moreover, airplane mode reduces your exposure to electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation, which can interfere with sensitive aircraft equipment. Lastly, it helps minimize roaming charges, particularly when traveling internationally, by disconnecting from mobile networks and avoiding unexpected fees. To put it simply, using airplane mode on a flight enhances convenience, safety, and comfort.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Airplane mode is not just a precaution but a crucial safety measure during flights. It can disable all wireless communication features to prevent interference with sensitive aircraft systems, ensuring clear communication between the aircraft and ground control. Failure to activate airplane mode poses serious risks, potentially disrupting vital equipment like radio altimeters and compromising the safety of the flight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, aside from safety, there are several benefits to using airplane mode, including preserving battery life, speeding up charging, reducing interruptions, and minimizing exposure to electromagnetic radiation. Ultimately, adhering to airplane mode regulations enhances the overall convenience, safety, and comfort of air travel.</p>

"Energy experts, economists oppose govt plan to raise electricity tariff",Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/4158672.webp,Special,,"Energy experts, economists oppose govt plan to raise electricity tariff","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:5874:""<p>Energy experts and economists are voicing strong opposition against the government’s proposal to further increase electricity tariffs in Bangladesh. They are urging a re-evaluation of the power sector’s financial management, specifically pointing out excessive and questionable spending as a more viable solution to the sector’s financial woes.</p>
<p>They observed that currently there is 42 percent surplus electricity that can be attributed to government’s deals to set up costly power plants.</p>
<p>“Rampant, unjust expenses – from state-owned company board remunerations to large-scale power purchase deals – underscore the need for financial rectification over tariff hikes,” eminent energy expert Prof SM Shamsul Alam said.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/bangladesh-to-welcome-indonesian-investment-in-power-and-energy-sector-nasrul-hamid/130356"">Bangladesh to welcome Indonesian investment in power and energy sector: Nasrul Hamid</a></p>
<p>In a recent statement, State Minister for Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, Nasrul Hamid, hinted at an increase in electricity tariffs, starting from March, to counter the widening gap between production costs and sales revenues.</p>
<p>The move aims to alleviate financial pressures on the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and the national economy.</p>
<p>“We have to adjust power tariff at both the retail and bulk level to cover the production cost. However, gas prices may be adjusted only for the power plants,” Hamid declared, assuring that the impact on retail consumers would be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>Sources within the government revealed plans to implement a 5 percent hike in bulk electricity prices and a 3 percent increase at the retail level through an administrative order, bypassing traditional regulatory hearings.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/bangladesh-sweden-discuss-cooperation-in-green-energy-ict-with-more-investment/130041"">Bangladesh, Sweden discuss cooperation in green energy, ICT with more investment</a></p>
<p>According to Annual Report 2022-23 of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), per unit production cost was Tk 11.33, while electricity was sold at Tk 6.7 per unit — incurring a loss of about Tk 4.63 per unit.</p>
<p>This imbalance has led to a staggering loss of Tk 47,788 crore for the fiscal year, as the government grapples with purchasing electricity from private and international sources at significantly higher rates.</p>
<p>The government has been facing great trouble as it has to purchase electricity worth Tk 82,778 crore from private sector power producers, while it generates electricity worth Tk 13,307 crore from its own plants.</p>
<p>The annual report also shows that BPDB’s average per unit production cost from its own plants is Tk 7.63, while it is Tk 14.62 at the independent power producers or IPPs (private sector). At rental plants, the cost is Tk 12.53, at public plants Tk 6.85, and power imported from India cost Tk 8.77 per unit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sources in the BPDB said that in the last decade and a half, electricity prices have been increased on 11 occasions at the wholesale level and on 13 occasions at the consumer level.</p>
<p>In the current fiscal 2023-24, the gap between production cost and selling rate has further widened, and now average production cost of each unit is about Tk 12 while it’s selling at Tk 6.7 per unit.</p>
<p>Prof Shamsul Alam, also senior vice president of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB), said the unjust expenses in the state-owned power and energy entities have been established in the hearings of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC).</p>
<p>“But no steps were taken by the Power and Energy Ministry to address those issues. Rather, the regulatory body’s authority was taken away and it was turned non-functional by amending the relevant law,” the energy expert told UNB.</p>
<p>He said that in every case the government was found reluctant to take action to reduce the unjust expenses in the power and energy sector.</p>
<p>He also observed that the Rapid Increase of Power and Energy Supply (Special) Act has been key in creating the unbearable situation for which the government has to provide a huge capacity charge to the private power plant operators and subsidy to state entities.</p>
<p>“Now, the reality is that despite having 42 percent surplus electricity, the country has to endure significant load shedding, even during winter,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that it’s “ridiculous” that despite such surplus electricity and an obligation of capacity charge putting pressure on the economy, the government has announced a plan to import 9,000 MW of electricity from abroad.</p>
<p>Economist and Research Director at Centre for Policy Dialogue, Khondaker Golam Moazzem, in a recent seminar showed through a study report that all political parties in Bangladesh, except the ruling Awami League, want to get rid of capacity payments in the power sector.</p>
<p>He said that the reduction of over-generated power capacity was missing in the Awami League’s election manifesto announced before the January 7 national election.</p>
<p>He also recommended shutting down the costly rental power plants immediately to reduce the overall cost.</p>
<p>M. Tamim, special assistant to the chief advisor of the former caretaker government, said that without reducing the cost, the onus of the increased production cost is being imposed on the consumer.</p>
<p>“This way, the government subsidies can be reduced by increasing the electricity tariff. But it will neither address the dollar crisis, nor resolve the fuel import problem. So, load shedding cannot be prevented by increasing the power tariff,” he said.</p>

<p>Opposition lawmakers supporting Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in parliament in 2022, boycotted the session of the 371-member Punjab Assembly.</p>
<p>Nawaz thanked God in televised remarks and promised she would equally serve those who voted for her and those who opposed her. &ldquo;The doors of my heart and office will remain open for the opposition as well,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Nawaz's appointment was largely expected following the Feb. 8 parliamentary elections in which her father's Pakistan Muslim League party, or PML-N, emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly or lower house of the parliament and in the Punjab Assembly.</p>
<p>The PML-N, which was initially trailing candidates representing Khan's supporters &mdash; the former cricket player turned Islamist politician was barred from running &mdash; emerged last Friday as the largest single winner in the election after receiving 24 additional seats &mdash; 20 from out of the 60 seats reserved for women, as well as four seats out of 10 reserved for minorities. Nine independent members have also joined the PML-N.</p>
<p>The PML-N is now heading into a coalition with the Pakistan People&rsquo;s Party, or PPP, with Nawaz's uncle, former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on a firm path to becoming the next prime minister, his second term in office.</p>
<p>The Sharifs are one of the top two families that have dominated Pakistani politics for decades. Nawaz Sharif, who served three times as a premier, was ousted from power in 2017 in a graft case. Khan, who replaced Sharif in 2018, granted him permission to travel to London for medical treatment following a court order.</p>

<p>Sharif came back to Pakistan from self-imposed exile abroad and returned to politics ahead of the elections. In her father's absence, Nawaz had led political campaigns and taken over his work.</p>
<p>However, many critics say Nawaz's rise is yet another case of nepotism. Earlier, one of Shehbaz Sharif's sons, Hamza Shehbaz, had also served as the chief minister in Punjab.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-26 16:18:59,2024-02-26 16:22:27
Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of blocking aid to Palestinians in violation of a UN court order,AP/UNB,https://unb.com.bd/category/Sports/Middle East/131583,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/5962826.webp,World,Middle East,Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of blocking aid to Palestinians in violation of a UN court order,"a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:7595:""<p>Israel has failed to comply with an order by the United Nations' top court to provide urgently needed aid to desperate people in the Gaza Strip, Human Rights Watch said Monday, a month after a landmark ruling in The Hague ordered Israel to moderate its war.</p>
<p>In a preliminary response to a South African petition accusing Israel of genocide, the U.N.&rsquo;s top court ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza. It stopped short of ordering an end to its military offensive that has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the tiny Palestinian enclave. Israel vehemently denies the charges against it, saying it is fighting a war in self-defense.</p>
<p>One month later and nearly five months into the war, preparations are underway for Israel to expand its ground operation into Rafah, Gaza&rsquo;s southernmost town along the border with Egypt, where 1.4 million Palestinians have flooded into in search of safety.</p>
<p>Early Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s office said the army had presented to the War Cabinet its operational plan for Rafah as well as plans to evacuate civilians from the battle zones. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>The situation in Rafah, where dense tent camps have sprouted to house the displaced, has sparked global concern and Israel&rsquo;s allies have warned that it must protect civilians in its battle against Hamas.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.unb.com.bd/category/World/zelenskyy-31000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-since-russia-launched-full-scale-invasion/131564"">Zelenskyy: 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed since Russia launched full-scale invasion</a></p>
<p>Also Monday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said he was submitting his government's resignation. The move, which still must be accepted by President Mahmoud Abbas, could open the door to U.S.-backed reforms in the Palestinian Authority, which the U.S. wants to rule postwar Gaza but in a revitalized shape.</p>
<p>In its ruling last month, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to follow six provisional measures, including taking &ldquo;immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the orders, Israel also must submit a report on what it is doing to adhere to the measures within a month. While Monday marked a month since the court&rsquo;s orders were issued, it was not immediately clear whether Israel had handed in such a report. The Israeli Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said Israel was not adhering to the court&rsquo;s order on aid provision, citing a 30% drop in the daily average number of aid trucks entering Gaza in the weeks following the court&rsquo;s ruling. It said Israel was not adequately facilitating fuel deliveries to hard-hit northern Gaza and blamed Israel for blocking aid from reaching the north, where the World Food Program said last week it was forced to suspend aid deliveries because of increasing chaos in the isolated part of the territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Israeli government has simply ignored the court&rsquo;s ruling, and in some ways even intensified its repression, including further blocking lifesaving aid,&rdquo; said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch.</p>

<p>Echoing Human Rights Watch, the Association of International Development Agencies, a coalition of over 70 humanitarian organizations working in Gaza and the West Bank, said aid deliveries have slowed since the court's ruling, with almost no aid reaching areas in Gaza north of Rafah.</p>
<p>Israel denies it is restricting the entry of aid and has instead blamed humanitarian organizations operating inside Gaza, saying hundreds of trucks filled with aid sit idle on the Palestinian side of the main crossing. The U.N. says it can&rsquo;t always reach the trucks at the crossing because it is at times too dangerous.</p>
<p>Netanyahu&rsquo;s office also said Monday the War Cabinet had approved a plan to deliver humanitarian aid safely into Gaza in a way that would &ldquo;prevent the cases of looting.&rdquo; It did not disclose further details.</p>
<p>The war, launched after Hamas-led militants rampaged across southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 people hostage, has unleashed unimaginable devastation in Gaza.</p>
<p>Nearly 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza, two thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza which does not distinguish in its count between fighters and noncombatants. Israel says it has killed 10,000 militants, without providing evidence.</p>

<p>Fighting has flattened large swaths of Gaza's urban landscape, displacing about 80% of the territory&rsquo;s 2.3 million people who have crammed into increasingly smaller spaces looking for elusive safety.</p>
<p>The crisis has pushed a quarter of the population toward starvation and raised fears of imminent famine, especially in the northern part of Gaza, which was the first focus of Israel&rsquo;s ground invasion and where starving residents have been forced to eat animal fodder and search for food in demolished buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish death for the children because I cannot get them bread. I cannot feed them. I cannot feed my own children,"" Naim Abouseido yelled in anguish as he waited for aid in Gaza City. ""What did we do to deserve this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bushra Khalidi, with U.K. aid organization Oxfam, told The Associated Press that it had verified reports that children have died of starvation in the north in recent weeks, which she said indicated aid was not being scaled up despite the court ruling.</p>
<p>Israel said that 245 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Sunday, less than half the amount that entered daily before the war.</p>
<p>But Human Rights Watch, citing U.N. figures, said that between Jan. 27 and Feb. 21, the daily average of trucks entering stood at 93, compared to 147 trucks a day in the three weeks before the world court&rsquo;s ruling. The daily average dropped further, to 57, between Feb. 9 and 21, the figures showed.</p>
<p>Aid groups say deliveries continue to be hobbled by security issues. The French aid groups M&eacute;decins du Monde and Doctors Without Borders each said that facilities belonging to them were struck by Israeli forces in the weeks following the court order.</p>
<p>United Nations agencies and aid groups say the hostilities, the Israeli military&rsquo;s refusal to facilitate deliveries and the breakdown of order inside Gaza make it increasingly difficult to get vital aid to much of the coastal enclave. In some cases, crowds of desperate Palestinians have surrounded delivery trucks and stripped the supplies off them.</p>
<p>The U.N. has called on Israel to open more crossings, including in the north, and to improve the coordination process.</p>"";}s:5:""image"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:8:""captions"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:3:""alt"";a:1:{i:0;N;}}",2024-02-26 16:24:48,2024-02-26 16:44:40

"Robi’s call drop rate lowest in the country, CEO says",Karim Waheed,,https://cosmosgroup.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/news/1899761.webp,Special,,"Robi’s call drop rate lowest in the country, CEO says","a:4:{s:7:""details"";a:1:{i:0;s:9903:""<p>Rajeev Sethi assumed the role of Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Robi Axiata in October 2022. Prior to this, he was associated with the mobile operator Ooredoo in Myanmar. He also served as the Chief Commercial Officer of Airtel Africa. His professional journey includes leadership roles in renowned companies like Vodafone, HP, Hutchison Telecom, and Asian Paints. An MBA specializing in marketing, finance, and operations, Sethi’s familiarity with Bangladesh is not recent. He has previously held the position of CEO at GrameenPhone. In an exclusive interview with UNB, Sethi talked about Robi’s growth, his experience in the telecom sector in Bangladesh and more.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Robi recorded a 16 percent leap in its revenue in FY 2023. Profits also went up by 74 percent. Can you elaborate on that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Setting records isn’t necessarily crucial. It’s common for expanding businesses to break their own revenue records annually. However, what stands out is Robi’s impressive rate of business expansion in 2023. The company saw its highest revenue and profit growth in its 27-year history that year. Furthermore, Robi’s 2023 growth outpaced all other telecom companies in Bangladesh. Based on the data available for mobile operators in the Asia and Pacific region, Robi’s growth was unmatched.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What do you believe contributed to this success?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It’s the outcome of persistent endeavours. We’ve significantly enhanced our network. I can confidently state that Robi currently has the superior network for both voice calls and internet usage. This is a key factor in our success.</p>
<p>We’ve simplified our internet and minute packages to be user-friendly. We’ve strived to provide packages that cater to our subscribers’ preferences. Our branding efforts have also been successful. We’ve launched a new branding campaign called “Parbe tumio”.</p>
<p>The positive business results are the culmination of all these efforts.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Why hasn’t Robi, despite being operational since 1997, been able to generate profits at the same level as its competitors?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> There are multiple factors at play. The game is all about numbers and reach. The higher the subscriber count, the greater the revenue and profit. More subscribers translate to reduced operational costs per subscriber. Given the current state of the telecom sector, it’s challenging for smaller operators to boost their profits.</p>
<p>Globally, various steps are taken to safeguard these smaller entities. This issue was also brought up in Bangladesh a few years back, but no effective measures were implemented. It’s not just about the profit or loss of any single operator. If a monopoly exists in the market, the subscribers are the ones who stand to lose.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Having had experience in the telecom sector of Bangladesh, what is your evaluation of the sector’s regulations, policies, and other rules?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> This question can be approached in several ways. One perspective is that the telecom sector in this country is an attractive investment opportunity due to the high population density, which is beneficial for establishing telecom infrastructure. A significant part of the population is young and eager for new experiences. Many homes without broadband connections present further opportunities for the telecom sector. However, the sector is burdened with extremely high taxes. For every 100 taka earned, 56 goes to the government – a rate that is double compared to neighbouring countries. The absence of a unified license to offer telecom services at various levels means that a company cannot independently provide all services and must rely on the tower company. This dependency not only increases costs but also impacts the quality of service.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: As an Indian living in Bangladesh, how would you compare the network quality of the two countries?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It really hinges on the standard of comparison. However, I can affirm that the network quality I experience in Dhaka surpasses that in Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: There are complaints from consumers in Bangladesh about the service quality. Specific issues include lack of network coverage at home and call drops. What’s your perspective on this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> It’s common for people to voice their complaints on social media when they’re dissatisfied with a service, rather than when they’re content. Given the millions of calls made daily, a few call drops are inevitable due to the imperfect nature of radio waves. It’s important to assess whether the call drop rates exceed both local and international standards. For instance, Robi’s call drop rate is 0.2, the lowest in the country. However, we continuously strive to enhance our service. We’re attempting to establish towers in certain challenging locations like Ukhia in Cox’s Bazar, but acquiring the necessary land for tower setup presents its own set of difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Isn’t there also a need to augment the number of towers in Dhaka?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Definitely. We have the equipment to establish approximately 600 towers, but they’re currently unused in our warehouse due to space constraints. We’re in talks with regulatory bodies and tower companies. The idea of sharing towers seems promising, and we’re exploring that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What strategies can be employed to boost internet usage in Bangladesh?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> The majority of individuals in Bangladesh access the internet via their smartphones. To boost internet usage, it’s crucial to make smartphones more affordable; they are currently quite expensive in this country. Local firms have begun producing smartphones, and it’s worth exploring how to reduce their prices.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: The government is discussing the implementation of high-speed 5G internet service. Are the service providers prepared, and is there a market demand for 5G?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> In terms of service providers, we are indeed prepared for 5G. However, the market readiness is a separate issue. For the average user, 5G won’t significantly alter their experience, as it will be similar to their current internet movie-watching experience. The real need for 5G lies in the industrial and service sectors. The extent of automation in these sectors needs to be evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Why did Robi recently establish two subsidiary firms, Axentec and r-ventures?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to cater to business entities. Currently, the revenue from this sector is minimal, but it’s expected to grow as services expand in the future. With a forward-looking approach, a new company has been established and a new CEO has been appointed. It’s noteworthy that similar businesses have seen a significant increase in revenue in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: Is Robi considering issuing additional shares in the capital market?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> This falls under the purview of the board of directors. However, to the best of my knowledge, it’s not currently being considered.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What would you highlight as the challenges and opportunities of investing in Bangladesh?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> Investors prefer a stable policy environment as it facilitates strategic planning. Abrupt alterations in government policies related to investment can cause concern among investors. The presence of a third-party dispute resolution mechanism is crucial in business, a role typically fulfilled by the court. An unbiased judicial system is a fundamental requirement for investment. If one were to select a country for investment in the telecom sector, Bangladesh would be a prime choice. The country offers numerous advantages for investment.</p>
<p><strong>UNB: What is your perception of Bangladeshis after working here for an extended period of time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rajeev Sethi:</strong> I have a deep affection for Bangladesh. People here are incredibly amicable and possess a keen interest in gaining knowledge and learning. Their passion for cricket is evident. This country is brimming with untapped talent that the world is yet to discover. We conducted a talent hunt in the digital sector and were astounded by the exceptional young talents we found. Unlike me, who is in the 40 to 50 age bracket, these are young individuals aged around 25 to 30. They require an appropriate platform to showcase their abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Robi’s Financial Facts for 2023</strong></p>
<p>Robi reported a revenue of approximately Tk 99.42 billion and a post-tax profit of Tk 3.21 billion. The total investment since the company’s inception is Tk 380 billion. The company boasts a subscriber base of 55.7 million. It was listed on the stock market on December 24, 2020, with a share market value of Tk 31.20 and offers a cash dividend of 10%.</p>
